	abstract = {To engage in proliferation, cells need to increase their biomass and replicate their genome. This process presents a substantial bioenergetic challenge: proliferating cells must increase {ATP} production and acquire or synthesize raw materials, including lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. To do so, proliferating cells actively reprogramme their intracellular metabolism from catabolic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ({OXPHOS}) to glycolysis and other anabolic pathways. This metabolic reprogramming, which directs nutrient uptake and metabolism during cell activation and proliferation, is under the control of specific signal transduction pathways. The underlying molecular mechanisms of cell metabolism reprogramming and their relevance to physiology and disease are currently under intense study. Several reports have uncovered the mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming that drive high rates of cell proliferation in cancer. Some recent studies have elucidated the physiological role of metabolic reprogramming during T-cell activation, differentiation and trafficking, which are potentially relevant to inflammatory disorders. This review describes the impact of metabolic reprogramming on the pathogenesis of cancer and the physiology of T-cell-mediated immune responses, with an emphasis on the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase–serine/threonine kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and the recently discovered metabolic processes regulated by nuclear factor-κB. These discoveries will hopefully translate into a better understanding of the role of metabolic reprogramming as a key regulator of T-cell-mediated immune responses and offer novel, immune-based therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {We have previously shown that exposure of C57BL/6J mice to intermittent hypoxia ({IH}) leads to 1) hypertriglyceridemia due to upregulation of pathways of lipid biosynthesis, including sterol regulatory element binding protein ({SREBP})-1 and stearoyl {CoA} desaturase ({SCD})-1; and 2) hypercholesterolemia due to impaired cholesterol uptake. The goal of the present study was to examine whether hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF})-1 is implicated in changes in lipid metabolism induced by {IH}. Lean {HIF}-1α (Hif1a)+/− mice, which are heterozygous for a null allele at the locus encoding the {HIF}-1α subunit, and their wild-type ({WT}) Hif1a+/+ littermates were exposed to {IH} or control conditions for 5 days. {IH} increased fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides ({TG}), and leptin in mice of both genotypes, whereas serum insulin and interleukin-6 were elevated only in {WT} mice. The impact of {IH} on serum {TG} levels in {WT} mice was significantly greater than that in Hif1a+/− mice (95 ± 9 vs. 66 ± 6 mg/dl, P {\textless} 0.05), whereas cholesterol and glucose levels were affected independently of genotype. Under hypoxic conditions, {mRNA} and protein levels of {SREBP} cleavage-activating protein ({SCAP}) and {SCD}-1 and protein levels of nuclear isoform of {SREBP}-1 in the liver were induced to significantly higher levels in {WT} mice than in Hif1a+/− mice. We conclude that 1) the effect of {IH} on serum {TG} levels is mediated through {HIF}-1, 2) {HIF}-1 may impact on posttranscriptional regulation of {SREBP}-1, and 3) the effect of {IH} on serum cholesterol levels was not altered by partial {HIF}-1α deficiency.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea, a syndrome leading to recurrent intermittent hypoxia ({IH}), has been associated previously with hypercholesterolemia, independent of underlying obesity. We examined the effects of experimentally induced {IH} on serum lipid levels and pathways of lipid metabolism in the absence and presence of obesity. Lean C57BL/6J mice and leptin-deficient obese C57BL/6J-Lepob mice were exposed to {IH} for five days to determine changes in serum lipid profile, liver lipid content, and expression of key hepatic genes of lipid metabolism. In lean mice, exposure to {IH} increased fasting serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol, phospholipids ({PLs}), and triglycerides ({TGs}), as well as liver {TG} content. These changes were not observed in obese mice, which had hyperlipidemia and fatty liver at baseline. In lean mice, {IH} increased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 ({SREBP}-1) levels in the liver, increased {mRNA} and protein levels of stearoyl–coenzyme A desaturase 1 ({SCD}-1), an important gene of {TG} and {PL} biosynthesis controlled by {SREBP}-1, and increased monounsaturated fatty acid content in serum, which indicated augmented {SCD}-1 activity. In addition, in lean mice, {IH} decreased protein levels of scavenger receptor B1, regulating uptake of cholesterol esters and {HDL} by the liver. We conclude that exposure to {IH} for five days increases serum cholesterol and {PL} levels, upregulates pathways of {TG} and {PL} biosynthesis, and inhibits pathways of cholesterol uptake in the liver in the lean state but does not exacerbate the pre-existing hyperlipidemia and metabolic disturbances in leptin-deficient obesity.},

	abstract = {Chronic alcohol causes hepatic steatosis and liver hypoxia. Hypoxia-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, ({HIF}-1α) may regulate liporegulatory genes, but the relationship of {HIF}-1 to steatosis remains unknown. We investigated {HIF}-1α in alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Alcohol administration resulted in steatosis, increased liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase ({ALT}) levels, suggesting liver injury in wild-type ({WT}) mice. There was increased hepatic {HIF}-1α messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}), protein, and {DNA}-binding activity in alcohol-fed mice compared with controls. Mice engineered with hepatocyte-specific {HIF}-1 activation ({HIF}1dPA) had increased {HIF}-1α {mRNA}, protein, and {DNA}-binding activity, and alcohol feeding in {HIF}1dPA mice increased hepatomegaly and hepatic triglyceride compared with {WT} mice. In contrast, hepatocyte-specific deletion of {HIF}-1α [{HIF}-1α(Hep−/−)], protected mice from alcohol- and lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced liver damage, serum {ALT} elevation, hepatomegaly, and lipid accumulation. {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−), {WT}, and {HIF}1dPA mice had equally suppressed levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α {mRNA} after chronic ethanol, whereas the {HIF} target, adipocyte differentiation-related protein, was up-regulated in {WT} mice but not {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−) ethanol-fed/{LPS}-challenged mice. The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ({MCP}-1) was cooperatively induced by alcohol feeding and {LPS} in {WT} but not {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−) mice. Using Huh7 hepatoma cells in vitro, we found that {MCP}-1 treatment induced lipid accumulation and increased {HIF}-1α protein expression as well as {DNA}-binding activity. Small interfering {RNA} inhibition of {HIF}-1α prevented {MCP}-1–induced lipid accumulation, suggesting a mechanistic role for {HIF}-1α in hepatocyte lipid accumulation. Conclusion: Alcohol feeding results in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes involving {HIF}-1α activation. The alcohol-induced chemokine {MCP}-1 triggers lipid accumulation in hepatocytes via {HIF}-1α activation, suggesting a mechanistic link between inflammation and hepatic steatosis in alcoholic liver disease.

	abstract = {Inappropriate regulation of the {PI}3-kinase/{PTEN}/Akt kinase-signalling cassette, a key downstream target of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling ({IIS}), is associated with several major human diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cancer. In Drosophila, studies have recently revealed that different subcellular pools of activated, phosphorylated Akt can modulate different {IIS}-dependent processes. For example, a specific pool of activated Akt within the cytoplasm alters aspects of lipid metabolism, a process that is misregulated in both obesity and diabetes. However, it remains unclear how this pool is regulated. Here we show that the protein phosphatase {PP}2A-B′ regulatory subunit Widerborst (Wdb), which coimmunoprecipitates with Akt in vivo, selectively modulates levels of activated Akt in the cytoplasm. It alters lipid droplet size and expression of the lipid storage perilipin-like protein {LSD}2 in the Drosophila ovary, but not in epithelial cells of the eye imaginal discs. We conclude that isoforms of {PP}2A-B′ can act as subcellular-compartment-specific regulators of {PI}3-kinase/{PTEN}/Akt kinase signalling and {IIS}, potentially providing new targets for modulating individual subcellular pools of activated Akt in insulin-linked disease.},

	abstract = {Phosphorylation is a major post-translational modification widely used in the regulation of many cellular processes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase activated by activation subunit p35. Cdk5-p35 regulates various neuronal activities such as neuronal migration, spine formation, synaptic activity, and cell death. The kinase activity of Cdk5 is regulated by proteolysis of p35: proteasomal degradation causes down-regulation of Cdk5, whereas cleavage of p35 by calpain causes overactivation of Cdk5. Phosphorylation of p35 determines the proteolytic pathway. We have previously identified Ser8 and Thr138 as major phosphorylation sites using metabolic labeling of cultured cells followed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphospecific antibodies. However, these approaches cannot determine the extent of p35 phosphorylation in vivo. Here we report the use of Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} to reveal the phosphorylation states of p35 in neuronal culture and brain. Using Phos-tag acrylamide, the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated p35 was delayed because it is trapped at Phos-tag sites. We found a novel phosphorylation site at Ser91, which was phosphorylated by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase {II} in vitro. We constructed phosphorylation-dependent banding profiles of p35 and Ala substitution mutants at phosphorylation sites co-expressed with Cdk5 in {COS}-7 cells. Using the standard banding profiles, we assigned respective bands of endogenous p35 with combinations of phosphorylation states and quantified Ser8, Ser91, and Thr138 phosphorylation. The highest level of p35 phosphorylation was observed in embryonic brain; Ser8 was phosphorylated in all p35 molecules, whereas Ser91 was phosphorylated in 60\% and Thr138 was phosphorylated in ∼12\% of p35 molecules. These are the first quantitative and site-specific measurements of phosphorylation of p35, demonstrating the usefulness of Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} for analysis of phosphorylation states of in vivo proteins.},

A dinuclear Mn2+ complex that binds to phosphate groups (the Phos-tag) is covalently attached to the polyacrylamide gel matrix. Thus, phosphorylated proteins are retarded in their migration and can be distinguished from their non-phosphorylated counterparts. We applied Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} to the analysis of the ζ, {CD}3ɛ and {CD}3δ subunits of the T cell antigen receptor ({TCR}-{CD}3). Pervanadate stimulation generated six different phospho-ζ and each two different {CD}3ɛ and {CD}3δ forms. This corresponds to the phosphorylatable tyrosines on their cytoplasmic tails. The phosphorylation pattern was compatible with random phosphorylation events. Further, we showed that the Phos-tag technology can be applied to Blue Native ({BN})-{PAGE}. This extends the applicability to the analysis of native protein complexes. Upon pervanadate stimulation the {TCR}-{CD}3 complex was predominantly detected as two distinct phospho-complexes. In contrast, the B cell antigen receptor ({BCR}) appeared as one phospho-form. Thus, Phos-tag {BN}-{PAGE} is useful for the analysis of different phosphorylation states of multiprotein complexes.},

Short hairpin {RNAs} ({shRNAs}) provide powerful experimental tools by enabling stable and regulated gene silencing through programming of endogenous {microRNA} pathways. Since requirements for efficient {shRNA} biogenesis and target suppression are largely unknown, many predicted {shRNAs} fail to efficiently suppress their target. To overcome this barrier, we developed a “Sensor assay” that enables the biological identification of effective {shRNAs} at large scale. By constructing and evaluating 20,000 {RNAi} reporters covering every possible target site in nine mammalian transcripts, we show that our assay reliably identifies potent {shRNAs} that are surprisingly rare and predominantly missed by existing algorithms. Our unbiased analyses reveal that potent {shRNAs} share various predicted and previously unknown features associated with specific {microRNA} processing steps, and suggest a model for competitive strand selection. Together, our study establishes a powerful tool for large-scale identification of highly potent {shRNAs} and provides insights into sequence requirements of effective {RNAi}.},

The insulin/{TOR} signaling pathway plays a crucial role in animal homeostasis, sensing nutrient status to regulate organismal growth and metabolism. We identify here the Drosophila B' regulatory subunit of {PP}2A ({PP}2A-B') as a novel, conserved component of the insulin pathway that specifically targets the {PP}2A holoenzyme to dephosphorylate S6K. {PP}2A-B' knockout flies have elevated S6K phosphorylation and exhibit phenotypes typical of elevated insulin signaling such as reduced total body triglycerides and reduced longevity. We show that {PP}2A-B' interacts with S6K both physically and genetically. The human homolog of {PP}2A-B', {PPP}2R5C, also counteracts S6K1 phosphorylation, indicating a conserved mechanism in mammals. Since S6K affects development of cancer and metabolic disease, our data identify {PPP}2R5C as a novel factor of potential medical relevance.},

The numbers of necrotic and apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver, as well as the levels of serum aspartate transaminase ({AST}) and alanine transaminase ({ALT}), were increased significantly by {GalN}/{LPS} treatment compared to the appropriate controls.

Thioredoxin-interacting protein ({TXNIP}) is an α-arrestin family protein that is induced in response to glucose elevation. It has been shown to provide a negative feedback loop to regulate glucose uptake into cells, though the biochemical mechanism of action has been obscure. Here, we report that {TXNIP} suppresses glucose uptake directly, by binding to the glucose transporter {GLUT}1 and inducing {GLUT}1 internalization through clathrin-coated pits, as well as indirectly, by reducing the level of {GLUT}1 messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}). In addition, we show that energy stress results in the phosphorylation of {TXNIP} by {AMP}-dependent protein kinase ({AMPK}), leading to its rapid degradation. This suppression of {TXNIP} results in an acute increase in {GLUT}1 function and an increase in {GLUT}1 {mRNA} (hence the total protein levels) for long-term adaptation. The glucose influx through {GLUT}1 restores {ATP}-to-{ADP} ratios in the short run and ultimately induces {TXNIP} protein production to suppress glucose uptake once energy homeostasis is reestablished.},

Interestingly, muscle from pigs with the {RyR}1 mutation and C2C12 cells administered with 10 h caffeine showed higher (P \&lt; 0.05) {PP}2A activity compared to controls. More importantly, the inhibitory effect of caffeine on {AMPK} activity was attenuated by the {PP}2A inhibitor, calyculin A or {siRNA} induced knockdown of {PP}2A.

This process is called cellular respiration. In carbohydrate metabolism, the breakdown starts from digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract and is followed by absorption of carbohydrate components by the enterocytes in the form of monosaccharides. Monosaccharides are transferred to cells for aerobic and anaerobic respiration via glycolysis, citric acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway to be used in the starvation state. In the normal state, the skeletal muscle and liver cells store monosaccharides in the form of glycogen. In the obesity state, the extra glucose is converted to triglycerides via lipogenesis and is stored in the lipid droplets of adipocytes. In the lipotoxicity state, the lipid droplets of other tissues such as the liver, skeletal muscle and pancreatic beta cells also accumulate triacylglycerol. This event is the axis of the pathogenesis of metabolic dysregulation in insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In this paper a summary of the metabolism of carbohydrates is presented in a way that researchers can follow the biochemical processes easily.},

We have previously shown that expression of the transcription factor {ARNT}/{HIF}1β is reduced in islets of humans with type 2 diabetes. We have now found that {ARNT} is also reduced in livers of diabetics. To study the functional effect of its reduction, we created mice with liver-specific ablation (L-{ARNT} {KO}) using {ARNT} {loxP} mice and adenoviral-mediated delivery of Cre. L-{ARNT} {KO} mice had normal blood glucose but increased fed insulin levels. These mice also exhibited features of type 2 diabetes with increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased lipogenic gene expression, and low serum β-hydroxybutyrate. These effects appear to be secondary to increased expression of {CCAAT}/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/{EBPα}), farnesoid X receptor ({FXR}), and sterol response element-binding protein 1c ({SREBP}-1c) and a reduction in phosphorylation of {AMPK} without changes in the expression of enzymes in ketogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, or {FGF}21. These results demonstrate that a deficiency of {ARNT} action in the liver, coupled with that in β cells, could contribute to the metabolic phenotype of human type 2 diabetes.},

Here we studied how hepatic {AMPKα}2 isoform affects hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake in vivo. We generated mice deleted for the {AMPKα}2 gene specifically in the liver (liverα2KO). Liverα2KO mice were glucose intolerant and hyperglycemic in the fasted state. Hyperglycemia was associated with a 50\% higher endogenous glucose production than in controls as assessed in vivo. We then investigated whether this increased glucose production was sensitive to insulin. Insulin, when infused at a rate inducing physiological hyperinsulinemia, totally inhibited endogenous glucose production in liverα2KO mice, showing that they had normal insulin sensitivity. This was confirmed in vivo by normal insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and transcriptional regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6 phosphatase, and pyruvate kinase in liver during the fasted/fed transition. Leptin and adiponectin regulate hepatic glucose production, so we then infused these adipokines into liverα2KO mice. Neither of these adipokines regulated hepatic glucose production in mice lacking hepatic {AMPKα}2, whereas both did so in control mice. In conclusion, we show that the hepatic {AMPKα}2 isoform is essential for suppressing hepatic glucose production and maintaining fasting blood glucose levels in the physiological range. We also demonstrate that regulation of hepatic glucose production by leptin and adiponectin, but not insulin, requires hepatic {AMPKα}2 activity.},

	abstract = {{NF}-κB is an important transcription factor in the immune system, and aberrant {NF}-κB activity contributes to malignant diseases and autoimmunity. In T cells, {NF}-κB is activated upon {TCR} stimulation, and signal transduction to {NF}-κB activation is triggered by a cascade of phosphorylation events. However, fine-tuning and termination of {TCR} signaling are only partially understood. Phosphatases oppose the role of kinases by removing phosphate moieties. The catalytic activity of the protein phosphatase {PP}2A has been implicated in the regulation of {NF}-κB. {PP}2A acts in trimeric complexes in which the catalytic subunit is promiscuous and the regulatory subunit confers substrate specificity. To understand and eventually target {NF}-κB-specific {PP}2A functions it is essential to define the regulatory {PP}2A subunit involved. So far, the regulatory {PP}2A subunit that mediates {NF}-κB suppression in T cells remained undefined. By performing a {siRNA} screen in Jurkat T cells harboring a {NF}-κB-responsive luciferase reporter, we identified the {PP}2A regulatory subunit B56γ as negative regulator of {NF}-κB in {TCR} signaling. B56γ was strongly up-regulated upon primary human T cell activation, and B56γ silencing induced increased {IκB} kinase ({IKK}) and {IκBα} phosphorylation upon {TCR} stimulation. B56γ silencing enhanced {NF}-κB activity, resulting in increased {NF}-κB target gene expression including the T cell cytokine {IL}-2. In addition, T cell proliferation was increased upon B56γ silencing. These data help to understand the physiology of {PP}2A function in T cells and the pathophysiology of diseases involving {PP}2A and {NF}-κB.},

	abstract = {Earlier studies have demonstrated a functional link between B56\{gamma\}-specific protein phosphatase 2A (B56\{gamma\}-{PP}2A) and p53 tumor suppressor activity. Upon {DNA} damage, a complex including B56\{gamma\}-{PP}2A and p53 is formed which leads to Thr55 dephosphorylation of p53, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and the inhibition of cell proliferation. Although an enhanced interaction between p53 and B56\{gamma\} is observed after {DNA} damage, the underlying mechanism and its significance in {PP}2A tumor-suppressive function remain unclear. In this study, we show that the increased interaction between B56\{gamma\} and p53 after {DNA} damage requires {ATM}-dependent phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15. In addition, we demonstrate that the B56\{gamma\}3-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell cycle arrest in G1, and blockage of anchorage-independent growth are also dependent on Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 and p53-B56\{gamma\} interaction. Taken together, our results provide a mechanistic link between Ser15 phosphorylation-mediated p53-B56\{gamma\} interaction and the modulation of p53 tumor suppressor activity by {PP}2A. We also show an important link between {ATM} activity and the tumor-suppressive function of B56\{gamma\}-{PP}2A.},

Regulation is accomplished mainly by members of a family of regulatory subunits, which determine the substrate specificity, (sub)cellular localization and catalytic activity of the {PP}2A holoenzymes. Moreover, the catalytic subunit is subject to two types of post-translational modification, phosphorylation and methylation, which are also thought to be important regulatory devices. The regulatory ability of {PTPA} ({PTPase} activator), originally identified as a protein stimulating the phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity of {PP}2A, will also be discussed, alongside the other regulatory inputs. The use of specific {PP}2A inhibitors and molecular genetics in yeast, Drosophila and mice has revealed roles for {PP}2A in cell cycle regulation, cell morphology and development. {PP}2A also plays a prominent role in the regulation of specific signal transduction cascades, as witnessed by its presence in a number of macromolecular signalling modules, where it is often found in association with other phosphatases and kinases. Additionally, {PP}2A interacts with a substantial number of other cellular and viral proteins, which are {PP}2A substrates, target {PP}2A to different subcellular compartments or affect enzyme activity. Finally, the de-regulation of {PP}2A in some specific pathologies will be touched upon.},

We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of {PTPN}22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using {PTPN}22-D195A/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of {PTPN}22. These included three novel {PTPN}22 substrates (Vav, {CD}3ϵ, and valosin containing protein) and two known substrates of {PEP}, the mouse homolog of {PTPN}22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell antigen receptor ({TCR}) ζ was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that {PTPN}22-D195A/C227S interacted directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and {TCRζ}, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native {PTPN}22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native {PTPN}22 also dephosphorylated {TCRζ} in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with {TCRζ} when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing {TCRζ} as a direct substrate of {PTPN}22.},

	abstract = {Interaction between the heterodimeric form of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) and polyomavirus middle T antigen ({MT}) is required for the subsequent assembly of a transformation-competent {MT} complex. To investigate the role of {PP}2A catalytic activity in {MT} complex formation, we undertook a mutational analysis of the {PP}2A 36-{kDa} catalytic C subunit. Several residues likely to be involved in the dephosphorylation mechanism were identified and mutated. The resultant catalytically inactive C subunit mutants were then analyzed for their ability to associate with a cellular (B subunit) or a viral ({MT}) B-type subunit. Strikingly, while all of the inactive mutants were severely impaired in their interaction with B subunit, most of these mutants formed complexes with polyomavirus {MT}. These findings indicate a potential role for these catalytically important residues in complex formation with cellular B subunit, but not in complex formation with {MT}. Transformation-competent {MT} is known to associate with, and modulate the activity of, several cellular proteins, including pp60c-src family kinases. To determine whether association of {MT} with an active {PP}2A A-C heterodimer is necessary for subsequent association with pp60c-src, catalytically inactive C subunits were examined for their ability to form complexes containing pp60c-src in {MT}-expressing cells. Two catalytically inactive C subunit mutants that efficiently formed complexes with {MT} also formed complexes that included an active pp60c-src kinase, demonstrating that {PP}2A activity is not essential in cis in {MT} complexes for subsequent pp60c-src association.},

The serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) plays an essential role in many aspects of cellular functions and has been shown to be an important tumor suppressor. The core enzyme of {PP}2A comprises a 65 {kDa} scaffolding subunit and a 36 {kDa} catalytic subunit. Here we report the crystal structures of the {PP}2A core enzyme bound to two of its inhibitors, the tumor-inducing agents okadaic acid and microcystin-{LR}, at 2.6 and 2.8 � resolution, respectively. The catalytic subunit recognizes one end of the elongated scaffolding subunit by interacting with the conserved ridges of�{HEAT} repeats 11-15. Formation of the core enzyme forces the scaffolding subunit to undergo pronounced structural rearrangement. The scaffolding subunit exhibits considerable conformational flexibility, which is proposed to play an essential role in {PP}2A function. These structures, together with biochemical analyses, reveal significant insights into {PP}2A function and serve as a framework for deciphering the diverse roles of {PP}2A in cellular physiology.},

The aberrant accumulation of lipids in the liver (“fatty liver”) is tightly associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. Here we show that the impaired hepatic expression of transcriptional cofactor transducin beta-like ({TBL}) 1 represents a common feature of mono- and multigenic fatty liver mouse models. Indeed, the liver-specific ablation of {TBL}1 gene expression in healthy mice promoted hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis under both normal and high-fat dietary conditions. {TBL}1 deficiency resulted in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation due to impaired functional cooperation with its heterodimerization partner {TBL}-related ({TBLR}) 1 and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ({PPAR}) α. As {TBL}1 expression levels were found to also inversely correlate with liver fat content in human patients, the lack of hepatic {TBL}1/{TBLR}1 cofactor activity may represent a molecular rationale for hepatic steatosis in subjects with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.},

However, mechanisms for {PP}2A inactivation in human cancers are poorly understood. The aberrant expression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ({CIP}2A), a recently identified endogenous {PP}2A inhibitor in malignant cells, is one such mechanism. Various independent studies have validated {CIP}2A's role in promoting tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis and senescence-inducing therapies. Notably, high {CIP}2A expression predicts poor patient prognosis in several human cancer types. Among the oncogenic proteins dephosphorylated by {PP}2A, the {MYC} oncoprotein, which is phosphorylated at serine 62, has surfaced as a marker for the oncogenic activity of {CIP}2A. The positive-feedback loop between {CIP}2A and {MYC} augments the activity of {MYC} in cancer cells. In addition, {CIP}2A promotes the phosphorylation and activity of additional oncoproteins, including E2F1 and {AKT}. However, {CIP}2A is not essential for normal mouse growth and development. These findings indicate that {CIP}2A is a novel anticancer target based on {PP}2A reactivation and inhibition of the oncogenic activity of its downstream effectors. The potential approaches and feasibility of targeting {CIP}2A are discussed here. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6548–53. ©2013 {AACR}.},

	abstract = {Precise control of the balance between protein phosphorylation, catalyzed by protein kinases, and protein dephosphorylation, catalyzed by protein phosphatases, is essential for cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of this balance leads to pathophysiological states, driving diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Aberrant phosphorylation of components of the pathways that control cell growth and cell survival are particularly prevalent in cancer. One of the most studied tumor suppressors in these pathways is the lipid phosphatase {PTEN} (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), which dephosphorylates the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ({PIP}3), thus preventing activation of the oncogenic kinase {AKT} (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog). In 2005, the discovery of a family of protein phosphatases whose members directly dephosphorylate and inactivate {AKT} introduced a new negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) oncogenic pathway. Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase ({PHLPP}) isozymes comprise a novel tumor suppressor family whose two members, {PHLPP}1 and {PHLPP}2, are deleted as frequently as {PTEN} in cancers such as those of the prostate. {PHLPP} is thus a novel therapeutic target to suppress oncogenic pathways and is a potential candidate biomarker to stratify patients for the appropriate targeted therapeutics. This review discusses the role of {PHLPP} in terminating {AKT} signaling and how pharmacological intervention would impact this pathway.},

	abstract = {The clinical value of assessing tumor glucose metabolism via F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG}) {PET} imaging in oncology is well established; however, the poor spatial resolution of {PET} is a significant limitation especially for early stage lesions. An alternative technology is optical molecular imaging, which allows for subcellular spatial resolution and can be effectively used with topical contrast agents for imaging epithelial derived cancers. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical molecular imaging of glucose metabolism to aid in early detection of oral neoplasia. Fluorescently labeled deoxyglucose (2-{NBDG} (2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose)) was applied topically to tissue phantoms, fresh oral biopsies (n=32) and resected tumors specimens (n=2). High-resolution imaging results show that 2-{NBDG} can be rapidly delivered to oral epithelium using topical application. In normal epithelium, the uptake of 2-{NBDG} is limited to basal epithelial cells. In contrast high grade dysplasia and cancers show uptake of 2-{NBDG} in neoplastic cells throughout the lesion. Following 2-{NBDG} labeling, the mean fluorescence intensity of neoplastic tissue averages 3.7 times higher than that of matched non-neoplastic oral biopsies in samples from 20 patients. Widefield fluorescence images of 8-paired oral specimens were obtained pre- and post-labeling with 2-{NBDG}. Prior to labeling, neoplastic samples showed significantly lower autofluorescence than non-neoplastic samples. The fluorescence of neoplastic samples increased dramatically after labeling; the differential increase in fluorescence was on average 30 times higher in neoplastic samples than in normal samples. Topical application of 2-{NBDG} can therefore provide image contrast in both widefield and high-resolution fluorescence imaging modalities, highlighting its potential in early detection of oral neoplasia.},

{SIRT}6 is a member of a highly conserved family of {NAD}+-dependent deacetylases with various roles in metabolism, stress resistance, and life span. {SIRT}6-deficient mice develop normally but succumb to a lethal hypoglycemia early in life; however, the mechanism underlying this hypoglycemia remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that {SIRT}6 functions as a histone H3K9 deacetylase to control the expression of multiple glycolytic genes. Specifically, {SIRT}6 appears to function as a corepressor of the transcription factor Hif1α, a critical regulator of nutrient stress responses. Consistent with this notion, {SIRT}6-deficient cells exhibit increased Hif1α activity and show increased glucose uptake with upregulation of glycolysis and diminished mitochondrial respiration. Our studies uncover a role for the chromatin factor {SIRT}6 as a master regulator of glucose homeostasis and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches against metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity.},

	abstract = {Background
            Under stress, {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) plays a central role in energy balance, and the heat shock response is a protective mechanism for cell survival. The relationship between {AMPK} activity and heat shock protein ({HSP}) expression under stress is unclear.
         
         
            Methodology/Principal Findings
            We found that heat stress induced dephosphorylation of {AMPKα} subunit ({AMPKα}) in various cell types from human and rodent. In {HepG}2 cells, the dephosphorylation of {AMPKα} under heat stress in turn caused dephosphorylation of acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two downstream targets of {AMPK}, confirming the inhibition of {AMPK} activity by heat stress. Treatment of {HepG}2 cells with phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) inhibitor okadaic acid or inhibition of {PP}2A expression by {RNA} interference efficiently reversed heat stress-induced {AMPKα} dephosphorylation, suggesting that heat stress inhibited {AMPK} through activation of {PP}2A. Heat stress- and other {HSP} inducer ({CdCl}2, celastrol, {MG}132)-induced {HSP}70 expression could be inhibited by {AICAR}, an {AMPK} specific activator. Inhibition of {AMPKα} expression by {RNA} interference reversed the inhibitory effect of {AICAR} on {HSP}70 expression under heat stress. These results indicate that {AMPK} inhibition under stress contribute to {HSP}70 expression. Mechanistic studies showed that activation of {AMPK} by {AICAR} had no effect on heat stress-induced {HSF}1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation and binding with heat response element in the promoter region of {HSP}70 gene, but significantly decreased {HSP}70 {mRNA} stability.
         
         
            Conclusions/Significance
            These results demonstrate that during heat shock response, {PP}2A mediated {AMPK} inhibition upregulates {HSP}70 expression at least partially through stabilizing its {mRNA}, which suggests a novel mechanism for {HSP} induction under stress.},

	abstract = {Although aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is a hallmark of cancer, key questions, including when, how, and why cancer cells become highly glycolytic, remain less clear. For a largely unknown regulatory mechanism, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM}2) isoform is exclusively expressed in embryonic, proliferating, and tumor cells, and plays an essential role in tumor metabolism and growth. Because the receptor tyrosine kinase/{PI}3K/{AKT}/mammalian target of rapamycin ({RTK}/{PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR}) signaling cascade is a frequently altered pathway in cancer, we explored its potential role in cancer metabolism. We identified {mTOR} as a central activator of the Warburg effect by inducing {PKM}2 and other glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions. {PKM}2 level was augmented in mouse kidney tumors due to deficiency of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and consequent {mTOR} activation, and was reduced in human cancer cells by {mTOR} suppression. {mTOR} up-regulation of {PKM}2 expression was through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ({HIF}1α)-mediated transcription activation, and c-Myc–heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins ({hnRNPs})-dependent regulation of {PKM}2 gene splicing. Disruption of {PKM}2 suppressed oncogenic {mTOR}-mediated tumorigenesis. Unlike normal cells, {mTOR} hyperactive cells were more sensitive to inhibition of {mTOR} or glycolysis. Dual suppression of {mTOR} and glycolysis synergistically blunted the proliferation and tumor development of {mTOR} hyperactive cells. Even though aerobic glycolysis is not required for breach of senescence for immortalization and transformation, the frequently deregulated {mTOR} signaling during multistep oncogenic processes could contribute to the development of the Warburg effect in many cancers. Components of the {mTOR}/{HIF}1α/Myc–{hnRNPs}/{PKM}2 glycolysis signaling network could be targeted for the treatment of cancer caused by an aberrant {RTK}/{PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR} signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on the in vivo roles of the sterol regulatory element binding protein ({SREBP}) family indicate that {SREBP}-2 is more specific to cholesterogenic gene expression whereas {SREBP}-1 targets lipogenic genes. To define the molecular mechanism involved in this differential regulation, luciferase-reporter gene assays were performed in {HepG}2 cells to compare the transactivities of nuclear {SREBP}-1a, -1c, and -2 on a battery of {SREBP}-target promoters containing sterol regulatory element ({SRE}), {SRE}-like, or E-box sequences. The results show first that cholesterogenic genes containing classic {SREs} in their promoters are strongly and efficiently activated by both {SREBP}-1a and {SREBP}-2, but not by {SREBP}-1c. Second, an E-box containing reporter gene is much less efficiently activated by {SREBP}-1a and -1c, and {SREBP}-2 was inactive in spite of its ability to bind to the E-box. Third, promoters of lipogenic enzymes containing variations of {SRE} ({SRE}-like sequences) are strongly activated by {SREBP}-1a, and only modestly and equally by both {SREBP}-1c and -2. Finally, substitution of the unique tyrosine residue within the basic helix-loop-helix ({bHLH}) portion of nuclear {SREBPs} with arginine, the conserved residue found in all other {bHLH} proteins, abolishes the transactivity of all {SREBPs} for {SRE}, and conversely results in markedly increased activity of {SREBP}-1 but not activity of {SREBP}-2 for E-boxes.
These data demonstrate the different specificity and affinity of nuclear {SREBP}-1 and -2 for different target {DNAs}, explaining a part of the mechanism behind the differential in vivo regulation of cholesterogenic and lipogenic enzymes by {SREBP}-1 and -2, respectively.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

	abstract = {Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by a complex called cohesin, is crucial—particularly at centromeres—for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. In animal mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected by shugoshin until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle microtubules. However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) associating with human shugoshin. {PP}2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with {PP}2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres. Thus, we have revealed a conserved mechanism of centromeric protection of eukaryotic chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis.},

	abstract = {Segregation of homologous maternal and paternal centromeres to opposite poles during meiosis I depends on post-replicative crossing over between homologous non-sister chromatids, which creates chiasmata and therefore bivalent chromosomes. Destruction of sister chromatid cohesion along chromosome arms due to proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Rec8 subunit by separase resolves chiasmata and thereby triggers the first meiotic division. This produces univalent chromosomes, the chromatids of which are held together by centromeric cohesin that has been protected from separase by shugoshin (Sgo1/{MEI}-S332) proteins. Here we show in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1 recruits to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). Its inactivation causes loss of centromeric cohesin at anaphase I and random segregation of sister centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of {PP}2A to chromosome arms prevents Rec8 phosphorylation and hinders resolution of chiasmata. Our data are consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by {PP}2A at meiosis I centromeres.},

Bovine serum albumin, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, immunoglobulin chains and {RNAse} A as well as a large number of E. coli proteins have been biotinylated. The biotinylation reaction is proximity dependent in that the extent of biotinylation is much greater when the ligase is coupled to the acceptor protein than when the acceptor is free in solution. This is presumably due to rapid hydrolysis of the acylation agent, biotinoyl-5'-{AMP}. Therefore, when the mutant ligase is attached to one partner involved in a protein-protein interaction, it can be used to specifically tag the other partner with biotin, thereby permitting facile detection and recovery of the proteins by existing avidin/streptavidin technology.},

	abstract = {Elevated levels of free fatty acids contribute to cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study was aimed to determine if free fatty acid inhibits the {AMP}-activated kinase ({AMPK}). Exposure of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells ({BAECs}) to palmitate (0.4 mm) but not to palmitoleic or oleic acid (0.4 mm) for 40 h significantly reduced the Thr172 phosphorylation of {AMPK}-α without altering its protein expression or the phosphorylation of {LKB}1-Ser428, a major {AMPK} kinase in {BAECs}. Further, in {LKB}1-deficient cells, palmitate suppressed {AMPK}-Thr172 implying that the inhibitory effects of palmitate on {AMPK} might be independent of {LKB}1. In contrast, 2-bromopalmitate, a non-metabolizable analog of palmitate, did not alter the phosphorylation of {AMPK} and acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase. Further, palmitate significantly increased the activity of protein phosphatase ({PP})2A. Inhibition of {PP}2A with either okadaic acid, a selective {PP}2A inhibitor, or {PP}2A small interference {RNA} abolished palmitate-induced inhibition on {AMPK}-Thr172 phosphorylation. Exposure of {BAECs} to C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable analog of ceramide, mimicked the effects of palmitate. Conversely, fumonisin B1, which selectively inhibits ceramide synthase and decreases de novo formation of ceramide, abolished the effects of palmitate on both {PP}2A and {AMPK}. Inhibition of {AMPK} in parallel with increased {PP}2A activity was founded in C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat diet ({HFD}) rich in palmitate but not in mice fed with {HFD} rich in oleate. Moreover, inhibition of {PP}2A with {PP}2A-specific {siRNA} but not scrambled {siRNA} reversed {HFD}-induced inhibition on the phosphorylation of {AMPK}-Thr172 and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ({eNOS})-Ser1177 in mice fed with high fat diets. Taken together, we conclude that palmitate inhibits the phosphorylation of both {AMPK} and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in endothelial cells via ceramide-dependent {PP}2A activation.},

	abstract = {In the postprandial state, the liver takes up and stores glucose to minimize the fluctuation of glycemia. Elevated insulin concentrations, an increase in the load of glucose reaching the liver, and the oral/enteral/portal vein route of glucose delivery (compared with the peripheral intravenous route) are factors that increase the rate of net hepatic glucose uptake ({NHGU}). The entry of glucose into the portal vein stimulates a portal glucose signal that not only enhances {NHGU} but concomitantly reduces muscle glucose uptake to ensure appropriate partitioning of a glucose load. This coordinated regulation of glucose uptake is likely neurally mediated, at least in part, because it is not observed after total hepatic denervation. Moreover, there is evidence that both the sympathetic and the nitrergic innervation of the liver exert a tonic repression of {NHGU} that is relieved under feeding conditions. Further, the energy sensor 5′{AMP}-activated protein kinase appears to be involved in regulation of {NHGU} and glycogen storage. Consumption of a high-fat and high-fructose diet impairs {NHGU} and glycogen storage in association with a reduction in glucokinase protein and activity. An understanding of the impact of nutrients themselves and the route of nutrient delivery on liver carbohydrate metabolism is fundamental to the development of therapies for impaired postprandial glucoregulation.},

For example, it mediates the effects of agents acting on the hypothalamus that promote feeding and entrains circadian rhythms of metabolism and feeding behaviour. Finally, recent studies reveal that {AMPK} conserves {ATP} levels through the regulation of processes other than metabolism, such as the cell cycle and neuronal membrane excitability.},

	abstract = {{AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) is a major therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes. We investigated the effect of a short-term overexpression of {AMPK} specifically in the liver by adenovirus-mediated transfer of a gene encoding a constitutively active form of {AMPKα}2 ({AMPKα}2-{CA}). Hepatic {AMPKα}2-{CA} expression significantly decreased blood glucose levels and gluconeogenic gene expression. Hepatic expression of {AMPKα}2-{CA} in streptozotocin-induced and ob/ob diabetic mice abolished hyperglycemia and decreased gluconeogenic gene expression. In normal mouse liver, {AMPKα}2-{CA} considerably decreased the refeeding-induced transcriptional activation of genes encoding proteins involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis and their upstream regulators, {SREBP}-1 (sterol regulatory element–binding protein-1) and {ChREBP} (carbohydrate response element–binding protein). This resulted in decreases in hepatic glycogen synthesis and circulating lipid levels. Surprisingly, despite the inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis, expression of {AMPKα}2-{CA} led to fatty liver due to the accumulation of lipids released from adipose tissue. The relative scarcity of glucose due to {AMPKα}2-{CA} expression led to an increase in hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone bodies production as an alternative source of energy for peripheral tissues. Thus, short-term {AMPK} activation in the liver reduces blood glucose levels and results in a switch from glucose to fatty acid utilization to supply energy needs.},

	abstract = {The liver plays a central role in glucose homeostasis in the whole-body by responding to environmental factors including nutrients, hormones, and oxygen. In conditions of metabolic overload such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, coordinated regulation between oxygen supply and consumption has been reported to be disrupted and subsequently cause tissue hypoxia, although pathological significance of the disease-related hypoxia remains elusive. To investigate the role of tissue hypoxia in the liver on systemic glucose homeostasis, mice lacking {HIF}-1α gene, a critical component of a master regulator of hypoxic response, in hepatocytes were exposed to high fat/sucrose diet ({HFSD}). Exposure to {HFSD} for 5 weeks elicited liver hypoxia with a transient increase in {HIF}-1α protein expression in the liver of control mice. Glucose disposal was marginally impaired in control mice when challenged oral glucose tolerance test, but such impairment was enhanced in the mutant mice. This alteration was accompanied by a complete inhibition of glucokinase induction with a significant reduction of hepatic glucose uptake. Mice fed {HFSD} for 20 weeks exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, whereas these metabolic phenotypes deteriorated considerably with severe insulin resistance in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues in the mutant mice. These findings suggest that {HIF}-1 in hepatocytes plays protective roles against the progression of diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {Complex cellular networks regulate regeneration, detoxification and differentiation of hepatocytes. By combining experimental data with mathematical modelling, systems biology holds great promises to elucidate the key regulatory mechanisms involved and predict targets for efficient intervention. For the generation of high-quality quantitative data suitable for mathematical modelling a standardised in vitro system is essential. Therefore the authors developed standard operating procedures for the preparation and cultivation of primary mouse hepatocytes. To reliably monitor the dynamic induction of signalling pathways, the authors established starvation conditions and evaluated the extent of starvation-associated stress by quantifying several metabolic functions of cultured primary hepatocytes, namely activities of glutathione-S-transferase, glutamine synthetase, {CYP}3A as well as secretion of lactate and urea into the culture medium. Establishment of constant metabolic activities after an initial decrease compared with freshly isolated hepatocytes showed that the cultured hepatocytes achieve a new equilibrium state that was not affected by our starving conditions. To verify the highly reproducible dynamic activation of signalling pathways in the in vitro system, the authors examined the {JAK}-{STAT}, {SMAD}, {PI}3 kinase, {MAP} kinase, {NF}-{kappaB} and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways. For the induction of gp130, {JAK}1 and {STAT}3 phosphorylation {IL}6 was used, whereas {TGFbeta} was applied to activate the phosphorylation of {SMAD}1, {SMAD}2 and {SMAD}3. Both Akt/{PKB} and {ERK}1/2 phosphorylation were stimulated by the addition of hepatocyte growth factor. The time-dependent induction of a pool of signalling competent beta-catenin was monitored in response to the inhibition of {GSK}3beta. To analyse whether phosphorylation is actually leading to transcriptional responses, luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by multiple copies of {TGFbeta}-responsive motives were applied, demonstrating a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by the {TNF}-like cytokine Fas ligand was studied in the in vitro system. Thus, the mouse hepatocyte in vitro system provides an important basis for the generation of high-quality quantitative data under standardised cell culture conditions that is essential to elucidate critical hepatocellular functions by the systems biology approach.},

	abstract = {{PTP}1B is a protein tyrosine-phosphatase located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum that plays an important role in the regulation of the insulin receptor ({IR}). Replacement of the conserved Asp-181 by alanine is known to convert {PTP}1B into a substrate-trapping protein that binds to but cannot dephosphorylate its substrates. In this work, we have studied the effect of an additional mutation (Y46F) on the substrate-trapping efficiency of {PTP}1B-D181A. We observed that this mutation converts {PTP}1B-D181A into a highly efficient substrate-trapping mutant, resulting in much higher recovery of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coimmunoprecipitated with {PTP}1B. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ({BRET}) experiments were also performed to compare the dynamics of interaction of the {IR} with these mutants. Basal {BRET}, which mainly reflects the interaction of {PTP}1B with the {IR} precursor during its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, was markedly increased with the {PTP}1B-D181A-Y46F mutant. In contrast, insulin-induced {BRET} was markedly reduced with {PTP}1B-D181A-Y46F. I125 insulin binding experiments indicated that {PTP}1B-D181-Y46F reduced the expression of {IR} at the plasma membrane. Reduced expression at the cell surface was associated with higher amounts of the uncleaved {IR} precursor in the cell. Moreover, we observed that substantial amounts of the uncleaved {IR} precursor reached the Tris-phosphorylated, fully activated form in an insulin independent fashion. These results support the notion that {PTP}1B plays a crucial role in the control of the activity of the {IR} precursor during its biosynthesis. In addition, this new substrate-trapping mutant may be a valuable tool for the identification of new {PTP}1B substrates.},

Sequence comparisons among these and previously described {AAVs} revealed the greatest divergence in capsid proteins. {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were not neutralized by heterologous antisera raised to the other serotypes. Neutralizing antibodies to {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were rare in human serum and, when present, were low in activity. Vectors formed with capsids from {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were generated by using rep and inverted terminal repeats ({ITRs}) from {AAV}2 and were compared with similarly constructed vectors made from capsids of {AAV}1, {AAV}2, and {AAV}5. Murine models of skeletal muscle and liver-directed gene transfer were used to evaluate relative vector performance. {AAV}7 vectors demonstrated efficiencies of transgene expression in skeletal muscle equivalent to that observed with {AAV}1, the most efficient known serotype for this application. In liver, transgene expression was 10- to 100-fold higher with {AAV}8 than observed with other serotypes. This improved efficiency correlated with increased persistence of vector {DNA} and higher number of transduced hepatocytes. The efficiency of {AAV}8 vector for liver-directed gene transfer of factor {IX} was not impacted by preimmunization with the other {AAV} serotypes. Vectors based on these novel, nonhuman primate {AAVs} should be considered for human gene therapy because of low reactivity to antibodies directed to human {AAVs} and because gene transfer efficiency in muscle was similar to that obtained with the best known serotype, whereas, in liver, gene transfer was substantially higher than previously described.},

Using {RNAi}, it is possible to knock down expression of viral {RNAs} including the pregenomic {RNA} from which the replicative intermediates are derived, thus reducing viral load, and the viral proteins that result in disease and impact the immune system's ability to eliminate the virus. We previously described the use of polymer-based Dynamic {PolyConjugate} ({DPC}) for the targeted delivery of {siRNAs} to hepatocytes. Here, we first show in proof-of-concept studies that simple coinjection of a hepatocyte-targeted, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated melittin-like peptide ({NAG}-{MLP}) with a liver-tropic cholesterol-conjugated {siRNA} (chol-{siRNA}) targeting coagulation factor {VII} (F7) results in efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines. Using transient and transgenic mouse models of {HBV} infection, we show that a single coinjection of {NAG}-{MLP} with potent chol-{siRNAs} targeting conserved {HBV} sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral {RNA}, proteins, and viral {DNA} with long duration of effect. These results suggest that coinjection of {NAG}-{MLP} and chol-{siHBVs} holds great promise as a new therapeutic for patients chronically infected with {HBV}.},

Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A), one of the main serine–threonine phosphatases in mammalian cells, maintains cell homoeostasis by counteracting most of the kinase-driven intracellular signalling pathways. Unrestrained activation of oncogenic kinases together with inhibition of tumour suppressors is often required for development of cancer. {PP}2A has been shown to be genetically altered or functionally inactivated in many solid cancers and leukaemias, and is therefore a tumour suppressor. For example, the phosphatase activity of {PP}2A is suppressed in chronic myeloid leukaemia and other malignancies characterised by aberrant activity of oncogenic kinases. Preclinical studies show that pharmacological restoration of {PP}2A tumour-suppressor activity by {PP}2A-activating drugs (eg, {FTY}720) effectively antagonises cancer development and progression. Here, we discuss {PP}2A as a druggable tumour suppressor in view of the possible introduction of {PP}2A-activating drugs into anticancer therapeutic protocols.},

The catalytic subunit {PP}2A C is encoded by two distinct and unlinked genes, termed Cα and Cβ. The specific function of these two catalytic subunits is unknown. To address the possible redundancy between {PP}2A and related phosphatases as well as between Cα and Cβ, the Cα subunit gene was deleted by homologous recombination. Homozygous null mutant mice are embryonically lethal, demonstrating that the Cα subunit gene is an essential gene. As {PP}2A exerts a range of cellular functions including cell cycle regulation and cell fate determination, we were surprised to find that these embryos develop normally until postimplantation, around embryonic day 5.5/6.0. While no Cα protein is expressed, we find comparable expression levels of {PP}2A C at a time when the embryo is degenerating. Despite a 97\% amino acid identity, Cβ cannot completely compensate for the absence of Cα. Degenerated embryos can be recovered even at embryonic day 13.5, indicating that although embryonic tissue is still capable of proliferating, normal differentiation is significantly impaired. While the primary germ layers ectoderm and endoderm are formed, mesoderm is not formed in degenerating embryos.},

	abstract = {The alpha and beta isoforms of the human protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit are encoded by distinct genes whose expression appears to be differentially regulated. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanism(s) that regulate(s) the expression of these two transcripts, we have cloned the genes encoding both isoforms. Both genes (each approximately 30 kbp) are composed of seven exons and six introns which intervene at identical locations, suggesting that they were derived from a common ancestral gene. However, the 5' upstream regions as well as the regions encoding the 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of each {mRNA} are different. The promoters of both genes are very G+C rich and lack the {TATA} and {CCAAT} sequences typical of many housekeeping genes. The C alpha gene contains several potential Sp1 binding sites and a potential {cAMP}-responsive element. Northern analysis using {RNAs} isolated from several different human cell lines showed that the steady-state C alpha {mRNA} was, in general, more abundant than the C beta {mRNA}. To determine whether the promoters regulate the differential C alpha and C beta {RNA} expression, they were fused to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and transiently expressed in {HeLa} cells. Expression from the C alpha promoter was 7-10 times stronger than that from the C beta promoter, which paralleled the endogenous C alpha and C beta {mRNA} levels in {HeLa} cells. These data suggest that the steady-state levels of the C alpha and C beta {mRNAs}, are due, at least in part, to different promoter activities.},

A model of the A subunit was developed on the basis of the fact that uncharged or hydrophobic amino acids are conserved at eight defined positions within each repeat. Helical wheel projections suggested that each repeat can be arranged as two interacting amphipathic helixes connected by a short loop. Mutational analysis of the A subunit revealed that the proposed loops are important for binding of tumor antigens, the B subunit, and the C subunit. Native gel analysis of mutant A subunits synthesized in vitro demonstrated that the binding region for the B subunit, previously thought to include repeats 2 to 8, covers repeats 1 to 10 and that the B and C subunits cooperate in binding to the A subunit.},

Here we report for the first time that oocyte-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a led to severe female subfertility without affecting follicle survival, growth, and ovulation. {PP}2A-Aalpha was essential for regulating oocyte meiotic maturation because depletion of {PP}2A-Aalpha facilitated germinal vesicle breakdown, causing elongation of the {MII} spindle and precocious separation of sister chromatids. The resulting eggs had high risk of aneuploidy, though they could be fertilized, leading to defective embryonic development and thus subfertility. Our findings provide strong evidence that {PP}2A-Aalpha within the oocyte plays an indispensable role in oocyte meiotic maturation, though it is dispensable for folliculogenesis in the mouse ovary.},

Aα mutations were discovered in a variety of human carcinomas. All carcinoma-associated mutant Aα subunits are defective in binding the B or B and C subunits. Here we describe two knock-in mice expressing cancer-associated Aα point mutants defective in binding B' subunits, one knockout mouse expressing truncated Aα defective in B and C subunit binding, and a floxed mouse for generating conditional Aα knockouts. We found that the cancer-associated Aα mutations increased the incidence of cancer by 50 to 60\% in lungs of {FVB} mice treated with benzopyrene, demonstrating that {PP}2A acts as a tumor suppressor. We show that the effect of Aα mutation on cancer incidence is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53. The finding that the Aα mutation E64D, which was detected in a human lung carcinoma, increases the lung cancer incidence in mice suggests that this mutation also played a role in the development of the carcinoma in which it was discovered.},

The proteins are 60-80\% identical and differ mostly at their termini. Two of the isoforms, B' beta 3 and B' gamma, contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal in their {COOH} terminus. No homology was found with other B- or B- related subunits. Northern analyses indicate a tissue-specific expression of the isoforms. Expression of B' alpha protein in Escherichia coli generated a polypeptide of approximately 53 {kDa}, similar to the size of the B' subunit present in the purified {PP}2A0. The recombinant protein was recognized by antibody raised against native B' and interacted with the dimeric {PP}2A (A.C2) to generate a trimeric phosphatase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the B' isoforms show significant homology to mammalian, fungal, and plant nucleotide sequences of unknown function present in the data bases. Notably, a high degree of homology (55-66\%) was found with a yeast gene, {RTS}1, encoding a multicopy suppressor of a rox3 mutant. Our data indicate that at least seven B' subunit isoforms may participate in the generation of a large number of {PP}2A0 holoenzymes that may be spatially and/or functionally targeted to different cellular processes.},

	abstract = {Differential association of regulatory B subunits with a core heterodimer, composed of a catalytic (C) and a structural (A) subunit, is an important mechanism that regulates protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). We have isolated and characterized three novel {cDNAs} related to the B' subunit of bovine cardiac {PP}2A. Two human (B'alpha1 and B'alpha2) and a mouse (B'alpha3) {cDNA} encode for alternatively spliced variants of the B subunit. The deduced primary sequences of these clones contain 12 of 15 peptides derived from the purified bovine B' subunit. Differences between the deduced sequences of the B alpha splice variants and the cardiac peptide sequences suggest the existence of multiple isoforms of the B' subunit. Comparison of the protein and nucleotide sequences of the cloned {cDNAs} show that all three forms of B'alpha diverge at a common splice site near the 3'-end of the coding regions. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that the B'alpha transcripts (4.3-4.4 kb) are widely expressed and very abundant in heart and skeletal muscle. The expressed human and mouse B'alpha proteins readily associated with the {PP}2A core enzyme in both in vitro and in vivo complex formation assays. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that epitope-tagged B'alpha was localized in both the cytosol and nuclei of transiently transfected cells. The efficiency of binding of all three expressed proteins to a glutathione S-transferase-A subunit fusion protein was greatly enhanced by the addition of the C subunit. Expression of the B'alpha subunits in insect Sf9 cells resulted in formation of {AC}.B'alpha heterotrimers with the endogenous insect A and C subunits. These results show that the B' subunit, which is the predominant regulatory subunit in cardiac {PP}2A, is a novel protein whose sequence is unrelated to other {PP}2A regulatory subunits. The nuclear localization of expressed B'alpha suggests that some variants of the B' subunit are involved in the nuclear functions of {PP}2A.},

Amino acid sequence data of the 72-{kDa} regulatory subunit (termed {PR}72) were used to isolate {cDNAs} from human heart and fetal brain libraries and libraries derived from {WI}-38 and {MCF}-7 cells. The clones isolated from the heart {cDNA} library revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 {kDa}. All the peptides sequenced from the protein matched with the sequence predicted from the {cDNA}. However, in vitro transcription and translation from this {cDNA} yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 {kDa} on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. From brain we isolated {cDNA} clones spanning an open reading frame encoding a 130-{kDa} protein (termed {PR}130). The apparent molecular mass of the protein produced by in vitro transcription and translation was 130 {kDa}. This protein has exactly the same deduced C-terminal protein sequence as the {PR}72 subunit from amino acids 45 to 527 but has an N-terminal extension of 665 amino acids. It is likely, therefore, that these two proteins arise from the same gene by alternative splicing. In human tissues several transcripts were detected by Northern analysis generated probably by the use of different polyadenylation signals and alternative splicing. High levels of the {PR}72 {mRNAs} were detected in heart and muscle, while lower levels of {PR}130 transcripts were found in heart, brain, placenta, lung, muscle, and kidney.},

We report here the isolation, by virtue of its ability to associate with p107, of a novel Protein Phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) regulatory subunit, named {PR}59. {PR}59 shares sequence homology with a known regulatory subunit of {PP}2A, {PR}72, but differs from {PR}72 in its expression pattern and its functional properties. We show that {PR}59 co-immunoprecipitates with the {PP}2A catalytic subunit, indicating that {PR}59 is a genuine component of {PP}2A holo-enzymes. In vivo, {PR}59 associates specifically with p107, but not with {pRb}. Elevated expression of {PR}59 results in dephosphorylation of p107, but not of {pRb}, and inhibits cell proliferation by causing cells to accumulate in G1. These data support a model in which the distinct {PP}2A regulatory subunits act to target the {PP}2A catalytic subunit to specific substrates and suggest a role for {PP}2A in regulation of p107.},

We have identified two calmodulin ({CaM})-binding proteins that form stable complexes with the {PP}2A A/C heterodimer and may represent a novel family of {PP}2A B-type subunits. These two proteins, striatin and S/G(2) nuclear autoantigen ({SG}2NA), are highly related {WD}40 repeat proteins of previously unknown function and distinct subcellular localizations. Striatin has been reported to associate with the post-synaptic densities of neurons, whereas {SG}2NA has been reported to be a nuclear protein expressed primarily during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle. We show that {SG}2NA, like striatin, binds to {CaM} in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In addition to {CaM} and {PP}2A, several unidentified proteins stably associate with the striatin-{PP}2A and {SG}2NA-{PP}2A complexes. Thus, one mechanism of targeting and organizing {PP}2A with components of Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways may be through the molecular scaffolding proteins striatin and {SG}2NA.},

	abstract = {Akt is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Phosphorylation of Akt at regulatory residues Thr-308 and Ser-473 leads to its full activation. The protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) has long been known to negatively regulate Akt activity. The {PP}2A holoenzyme consists of the structural subunit (A), catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). Here we report the identification of the specific B regulatory subunit that targets the {PP}2A holoenzyme to Akt. We found endogenous association of {PP}2A {AB}55C holoenzymes with Akt by co-immunoprecipitation analyses in pro-lymphoid {FL}5.12 cells. Akt was shown to associate with ectopically expressed B55alpha subunit in {NIH}3T3 cells. The direct interaction between B55alpha subunit and Akt was confirmed using in vitro pulldown analyses. Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of B55alpha subunit significantly impaired phosphorylation at Thr-308, but to a lesser extent at Ser-473 of Akt in both {FL}5.12 and {NIH}3T3 cells. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of a subset of Akt substrates, including {FoxO}3a, was substantially decreased by B55alpha overexpression in these cells. Silencing of B55alpha expression markedly increased phosphorylation at Thr-308 but not at Ser-473 in both {FL}5.12 cells and {NIH}3T3 cells. Consistently, {PP}2A {AB}55alphaC holoenzymes preferentially dephosphorylated phospho-Thr-308 rather than phospho-Ser-473 in in vitro dephosphorylation assays. Furthermore, B55alpha overexpression retarded proliferation of {NIH}3T3 cells, and knockdown of B55alpha expression increased survival of {FL}5.12 cells upon interleukin-3 deprivation. Together, our data demonstrate that B55alpha-dependent targeting of the {PP}2A holoenzyme to Akt selectively regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 to regulate cell proliferation and survival.},

	abstract = {Wnt signaling increases beta-catenin abundance and transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Our previous work suggested that the B56 regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) inhibits Wnt signaling. Okadaic acid (a phosphatase inhibitor) increases, while B56 expression reduces, beta-catenin abundance; B56 also reduces transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Okadaic acid is a tumor promoter, and the structural A subunit of {PP}2A is mutated in multiple cancers. Taken together, the evidence suggests that {PP}2A is a tumor suppressor. However, other studies suggest that {PP}2A activates Wnt signaling. We now show that the B56, A and catalytic C subunits of {PP}2A each have ventralizing activity in Xenopus embryos. B56 was epistatically positioned downstream of {GSK}3beta and axin but upstream of beta-catenin, and axin co-immunoprecipitated B56, A and C subunits, suggesting that {PP}2A:B56 is in the beta-catenin degradation complex. {PP}2A appears to be essential for beta-catenin degradation, since beta-catenin degradation was reconstituted in phosphatase-depleted Xenopus egg extracts by {PP}2A, but not {PP}1. These results support the hypothesis that {PP}2A:B56 directly inhibits Wnt signaling and plays a role in development and carcinogenesis.},

	issn = {1476-5586},
	abstract = {The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ({eIF}4E) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and is associated with cellular transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastatic progression. It is known that Mnks can phosphorylate {eIF}4E. Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) functions as a tumor suppressor, and it was previously suggested to regulate {eIF}4E phosphorylation. However, how {PP}2A regulates {eIF}4E phosphorylation has not been fully addressed. In this study, we have not only validated the role of {PP}2A in regulation of {eIF}4E phosphorylation but also demonstrated the mechanism underlying this process. Inhibition of {PP}2A using either okadaic acid or {PP}2A small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) increased {eIF}4E phosphorylation, which could be abolished by the presence of the Mnk inhibitor {CGP}57380 or deficiency of Mnk genes. Thus, Mnks are involved in {PP}2A-mediated regulation of {eIF}4E phosphorylation. Moreover, a dephosphorylation assay revealed that {PP}2A could directly dephosphorylate Mnk1 and {eIF}4E. m(7){GTP} pull-down assay detected more {eIF}4G and phospho-{eIF}4E and less 4EBP-1 in {PP}2A {siRNA}-transfected cells than in control {siRNA}-transfected cells, indicating an increased cap binding of {eIF}4F complex. Accordingly, okadaic acid treatment or {PP}2A knockdown increased the levels of c-Myc and Mcl-1, which are proteins known to be regulated by a cap-dependent translation mechanism. Taken together, we conclude that {PP}2A negatively regulates {eIF}4E phosphorylation and {eIF}4F complex assembly through dephosphorylation of Mnk and {eIF}4E, thus suggesting a novel mechanism by which {PP}2A exerts its tumor-suppressive function.},

The finding of this phenomenon, termed the “Warburg effect,” stimulated much research on tumorigenesis, but few explanations were forthcoming to explain the observation. Recently, advanced developments in molecular biology and high-throughput molecular analyses have revealed that many of the signaling pathways altered by gene mutations regulate cell metabolism in cancer. Furthermore, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 were shown to elevate 2-hydroxyglutarate, which led to changes in α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme activity, resulting in an increased risk of malignant tumors. Although these findings led to a renewed interest in cancer metabolism, our knowledge on the specifics of tumor metabolism is still fragmented. This paper reviews recent findings related to key transcription factors and enzymes that play an important role in the regulation of cancer metabolism.},

	abstract = {The liver is a central organ that metabolizes excessive nutrients for storage in the form of glycogen and lipids and supplies energy-producing substrates to the peripheral tissues to maintain their function, even under starved conditions. These processes require a considerable amount of oxygen, which causes a steep oxygen gradient throughout the hepatic lobules. Alcohol consumption and/or excessive food intake can alter the hepatic metabolic balance drastically, which can precipitate fatty liver disease, a major cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis, through steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis, to liver cirrhosis. Altered hepatic metabolism and tissue remodeling in fatty liver disease further disrupt hepatic oxygen homeostasis, resulting in severe liver hypoxia. As master regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxic stress, hypoxia-inducible factors ({HIFs}) modulate various cellular and organ functions, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, metabolic demand, and cell survival, by activating their target genes during fetal development and also in many disease conditions such as cancer, heart failure, and diabetes. In the past decade, it has become clear that {HIFs} serve as key factors in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver formation. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia and {HIFs} regulate lipid metabolism in the development and progression of fatty liver disease.},

We used a “substrate-trap” technique involving a mutation in {MKP}-1 of the catalytically critical cysteine to a serine residue (“{CS}” mutant) to capture novel {MKP}-1 substrates. We transfected the {MKP}-1 ({CS}) mutant and control (wild-type, {WT}) constructs into phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ({PMA})-activated {COS}-1 cells. {MKP}-1-substrate complexes were immunoprecipitated, which yielded four bands of 17, 15, 14, and 10 {kDa} with the {CS} {MKP}-1 mutant but not the {WT} {MKP}-1. The bands were identified by mass spectrometry as histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4, respectively. Histone H3 was phosphorylated, and purified {MKP}-1 dephosphorylated histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) in vitro; whereas, histone H3 (phospho-Thr-3) was unaffected. We have previously shown that thrombin and vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) upregulated {MKP}-1 in human endothelial cells ({EC}). We now show that both thrombin and {VEGF} caused dephosphorylation of histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) and histone H3 (phospho-Thr-3) in {EC} with kinetics consistent with {MKP}-1 induction. Furthermore, {MKP}-1-specific small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) prevented {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation but had no effect on H3 (phospho-Thr-3 or Thr-11) dephosphorylation. In summary, histone H3 is a novel substrate of {MKP}-1, and {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation requires {MKP}-1. We propose that {MKP}-1-mediated H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation is a key regulatory step in {EC} activation by {VEGF} and thrombin.},

It is widely known that the liver is a central organ in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. However, over the last decades, a variety of pathological conditions highlighted the importance of metabolic functions within the diseased liver. As observed in Western societies, an increase in the prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome promotes pathophysiological changes that cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}). {NAFLD} increases the susceptibility of the liver to acute liver injury and may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Alterations in insulin response, β-oxidation, lipid storage and transport, autophagy and an imbalance in chemokines and nuclear receptor signaling are held accountable for these changes. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for lipid accumulation in inflammation and {ER} stress in the clinical context of liver regeneration and hepatic carcinogenesis. This review focuses on novel findings related to nuclear receptor signaling – including the vitamin D receptor and the liver receptor homolog 1 – in hepatic lipid and glucose uptake, storage and metabolism in the clinical context of {NAFLD}, liver regeneration, and cancer.},

Traditionally, adipose tissue in the visceral fat depot has been considered a major culprit in the development of insulin resistance. However, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of subcutaneous truncal/abdominal adipose tissue in the development of insulin resistance. There are significant differences in the functional characteristics of subcutaneous abdominal/truncal vs. intraabdominal vs. gluteo-femoral fat depots. More recently, mounting evidence has been supporting the role of adipose tissue function in the development of metabolic complications independent of adipose tissue volume or distribution. Decreased capacity for adipocyte differentiation and angiogenesis along with adipocyte hypertrophy can trigger a vicious cycle of inflammation leading to subcutaneous adipose tissue dysfunction and ectopic fat deposition. Therapeutic lifestyle change continues to be the most important intervention in clinical practice to improve adipose tissue function and avoid development of insulin resistance and related cardio-metabolic complications.},

Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) activity has been identified as a prerequisite for the transformation of human cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which {PP}2A activity is inhibited in human cancers are currently unclear. In this study, we describe a cellular inhibitor of {PP}2A with oncogenic activity. The protein, designated Cancerous Inhibitor of {PP}2A ({CIP}2A), interacts directly with the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, inhibits {PP}2A activity toward c-Myc serine 62 (S62), and thereby prevents c-Myc proteolytic degradation. In addition to its function in c-Myc stabilization, {CIP}2A promotes anchorage-independent cell growth and in vivo tumor formation. The oncogenic activity of {CIP}2A is demonstrated by transformation of human cells by overexpression of {CIP}2A. Importantly, {CIP}2A is overexpressed in two common human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) and colon cancer. Thus, our data show that {CIP}2A is a human oncoprotein that inhibits {PP}2A and stabilizes c-Myc in human malignancies.},

Some of them have proven to be tumor promoters in mouse skin two-step carcinogenesis and rat liver medium-term tests. Among these inhibitors, okadaic acid ({OA}) selectively inhibits {PP}2A, and its use has therefore been proposed to facilitate analysis of biological roles of this phosphatase. {OA} shows bimodal effects on in vitro transformation and, in addition to such epigenetic changes, also induces marked genetic changes. {OA} treatment for more than 1 week flattened {NIH} 3T3 transformants irreversibly, with loss of the transfected genes. It is also known to induce diphtheria toxin-resistant mutations in Chinese hamster lung cells and sister chromatid exchanges ({SCEs}) in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human lymphocytes. To analyze roles of protein phosphatases in gene stability, we isolated {OA}-resistant mutants. They were proven to have a mutation in the {PP}2A alpha catalytic subunit, in which cysteine 269 had been substituted for glycine; and it was demonstrated that this region interacts with {OA}. The recombinant mutant protein was 4 approximately 9-fold more resistant to {OA} than the wild type. Although the {OA} resistant mutants of {CHO} cells expressed high levels of P-glycoprotein, inhibition of {PP}2A itself was suggested to lead to {SCE} induction. However, the number of molecular species of {PP} which are known to be sensitive to {OA} continues to increase, and we have isolated {cDNA} for a novel type of {OA} sensitive {PP}.

	abstract = {Two subunits of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) have been shown previously to bind to the small t and middle T antigens ({ST} and {MT}, respectively) of polyomavirus. To determine sequences important for binding of {PP}2A to {ST} and {MT}, we first constructed a series of {ST} mutants in regions known to be important for biological activity of {ST} and {MT}. Several mutations in two small regions just amino terminal to the Cys-X-Cys-X-X-Cys motifs of {ST} and {MT} abolished {PP}2A binding to {ST} in vitro. Parallel mutations were constructed in {MT} to investigate the role of {PP}2A binding in the function of polyomavirus {MT}. Wild-type and mutant {MT} proteins were stably expressed in {NIH} 3T3 cells and analyzed (i) for their ability to induce transformation and (ii) for associated cellular proteins and corresponding enzymatic activities previously described as associating with wild-type {MT}. A number of the mutant {MTs} were found to be defective in binding of {PP}2A as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. In contrast, a deletion of the highly conserved stretch of amino acids 42 to 47 (His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Gly-Gly) in the {ST}-{MT}-large T antigen common region did not affect {PP}2A binding to {MT}. {MT} mutants defective for {PP}2A binding were also defective in transformation, providing further evidence that association with {PP}2A is important for the ability of {MT} to transform cells. All mutants which were impaired for {PP}2A binding were similarly or more dramatically impaired for associated protein and lipid kinase activities, supporting the possibility that {PP}2A binding is necessary for the formation and/or stability of an {MT}-pp60c-src complex.},

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become an epidemic, and virtually no physician is without patients who have the disease. Whereas insulin insensitivity is an early phenomenon partly related to obesity, pancreas β-cell function declines gradually over time already before the onset of clinical hyperglycaemia. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including increased non-esterified fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and mitochondrial dysfunction for insulin resistance, and glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and amyloid formation for β-cell dysfunction. Moreover, the disease has a strong genetic component, but only a handful of genes have been identified so far: genes for calpain 10, potassium inward-rectifier 6·2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, insulin receptor substrate-1, and others. Management includes not only diet and exercise, but also combinations of anti-hyperglycaemic drug treatment with lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and anti platelet therapy.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients with diabetes already fulfill one diagnostic criterion for {MS} according to the existing classifications. Our aim was to identify one single clinical parameter, which could effectively predict the presence of {MS} in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods
We studied all patients with type 2 diabetes who attended our Diabetes Outpatient Clinic during a three-month period. Waist circumference, blood pressure and serum lipids were measured. Establishment of {MS} diagnosis was based a) on National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel {III} ({NCEP} {ATP} {III}) criteria and b) on International Diabetes Federation ({IDF}) criteria. Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis was applied in order to identify the clinical parameter with the highest predictive capability for {MS}. Among the 500 participating patients (231 males, 269 females), {MS} was diagnosed in 364 patients (72.8\%) according to the {NCEP} {ATP} {III} criteria and in 408 patients (81.6\%) according to the {IDF} criteria.

Results
For the {NCEP} {ATP} {III} classification, serum triglycerides (in the overall population), waist and {HDL} (in female population) demonstrated the highest predictive capability for {MS} ({AUCs}:0.786, 0.805 and 0.801, respectively). For the {IDF} classification, no single parameter reached an {AUC} {\textgreater} 0.800 in the overall population. In females, {HDL} displayed a satisfactory predictive capability for {MS} with an {AUC} which was significantly higher than the one in males (0.785 vs. 0.676, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05).

Conclusion
Elevated serum triglycerides strongly indicate the presence of {MS} in patients with type 2 diabetes. In female patients with type 2 diabetes, central obesity was the second stronger predictor of {MS} besides hypertriglyceridemia.},

Moreover, a relationship between fasting concentrations of leptin and insulin has been described. Hyperinsulinemia is considered to be indicative of insulin resistance. We aimed at elucidating the interrelations between leptin, insulin and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. Under metabolic ward conditions, we investigated 21 moderately overweight men with type 2 diabetes. The patients had a mean age of 49.1 years, a mean body mass index ({BMI}) of 26.8 kg/m(2), and a mean diabetes duration of 82.5 months. All patients were treated with diet alone. We measured fasting leptin and insulin levels, body composition by determination of total body water, and insulin resistance by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. At univariate analysis, fasting leptin level significantly and positively correlated with {BMI} (r=0.49, p=0.02) and with fasting insulin (r=0.69, p=0.001), while it negatively correlated with the glucose disposal rate (r=-0.62, p=0.002). Furthermore, leptin was inversely correlated with {HDL}-cholesterol (r=-0.45, p=0.04). When excluding the influence of body fat mass or of {BMI} in partial correlation analysis, the correlations between leptin and insulin or insulin sensitivity remained significant. The relationship between insulin resistance (as measured directly in the clamp experiments) and leptin concentrations was also shown by subdividing the diabetic patients according to tertiles of insulin sensitivity. The highest fasting leptin levels were observed in those patients with the most expressed insulin resistance. Our data point to a functional relationship between insulin resistance and leptin concentrations in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic men, independently of body composition. This relationship is believed to be mediated by insulin.},

Individuals who progress to type 2 diabetes display features of low-grade inflammation years in advance of disease onset.

Mediators of inflammation such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin ({IL})-1beta, the {IL}-6 family of cytokines, {IL}-18, and certain chemokines have been proposed to be involved in the events causing both forms of diabetes. {IL}-6 has in addition to its immunoregulatory actions been proposed to affect glucose homeostasis and metabolism directly and indirectly by action on skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, hepatocytes, pancreatic beta-cells, and neuroendocrine cells. Here we argue that {IL}-6 action-in part regulated by variance in the {IL}-6 and {IL}-6alpha receptor genes-contributes to, but is probably neither necessary nor sufficient for, the development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Thus, the two types of diabetes are also in this respect less apart than apparent. However, the mechanisms are not clear, and we therefore propose future directions for studies in this field.},

To date 14 members of this family, also called the solute carrier 2A proteins have been identified which are divided on the basis of transport characteristics and sequence similarities into several families (Classes 1 to 3). The expression of these different receptor subtypes varies between different species, tissues and cellular subtypes and each has differential sensitivities to stimuli such as insulin. The liver is a contributor to metabolic carbohydrate homeostasis and is a major site for synthesis, storage and redistribution of carbohydrates. Situations in which the balance of glucose homeostasis is upset such as diabetes or the metabolic syndrome can lead metabolic disturbances that drive chronic organ damage and failure, confirming the importance of understanding the molecular regulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis. There is a considerable literature describing the expression and function of receptors that regulate glucose uptake and release by hepatocytes, the most import cells in glucose regulation and glycogen storage. However there is less appreciation of the roles of {GLUTs} expressed by non parenchymal cell types within the liver, all of which require carbohydrate to function. A better understanding of the detailed cellular distribution of {GLUTs} in human liver tissue may shed light on mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. This review summarises the available literature on hepatocellular expression of {GLUTs} in health and disease and highlights areas where further investigation is required.},

	abstract = {The quantitative disposition of an intragastrically administered glucose load was studied in eight conscious 18-h fasted dogs using isotopic and arteriovenous (A-V) techniques. During the control period, the gut utilized 25\% of the basal net hepatic glucose output (2.8 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1). After glucose ingestion, 80\% of the load was absorbed as glucose, 11\% was converted across the gut to lactate and alanine, and 4\% was oxidized to {CO}2. Two percent of the load remained in the gut 4 h after glucose administration and 3\% was unaccounted for. During the absorptive period, net hepatic glucose balance ({NHGB}) varied considerably (mean range = output of 1.8 to uptake of 9.1 mg.kg-1.min-1), while endogenous hepatic glucose production (Ra hp) showed a consistent 80\% suppression. The total net hepatic glucose uptake during the absorptive period (150 +/- 10 min) accounted for the disposal of 24 +/- 10\% of the ingested load, and the amount of glucose escaping the splanchnic bed was 40 +/- 3\%. Overall {NHGB} correlated positively with basal arterial glucose and insulin levels and negatively with basal arterial glycerol and {FFA} and with peak absorptive arterial glucose and insulin levels. These data suggest that the hepatic response to an ingested glucose load depends in part on the degree of metabolic fast of the animal at the time of glucose ingestion; the latter may be a major determinant of the roles played by the tissues in glucose disposal.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that insufficient insulin-stimulated activation of muscle glycogen synthesis is one of the major components of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus. Glycogen synthase, a key enzyme in muscle glycogen synthesis, is extensively regulated, both allosterically (by glucose-6-phosphate, {ATP}, and others) and covalently (by phosphorylation). Although glycogen synthase has been a topic of intense study for more than 50 years, its kinetic characterization has been confounded by its large number of phosphorylation states. Questions remain regarding the function of glycogen synthase regulation and the relative importance of allosteric and covalent modification in fulfilling this function. In this review, we consider both earlier kinetic studies and more recent site-directed mutagenesis and crystal structure studies in a detailed qualitative discussion of the effects of regulation on the kinetics of glycogen synthase. We propose that both allosteric and covalent modification of glycogen synthase may be described by a Monod–Wyman–Changeux model in terms of apparent changes to L, the equilibrium constant for transition between the T and R conformers. As, with the exception of L, all parameters of this model are independent of the glycogen synthase phosphorylation state, the need to determine kinetic parameters for all possible states is eliminated; only the relationship between a particular state and L must be established. We conclude by suggesting that renewed efforts to characterize the relationship between phosphorylation and the kinetics of glycogen synthase are essential in order to obtain a better quantitative understanding of the function of glycogen synthesis regulation. The model we propose may prove useful in this regard.},

	abstract = {Increased plasma levels of triglycerides ({TG}) in very low density lipoproteins ({VLDL}) are not only common characteristics of the dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but are the central pathophysiologic feature of the abnormal lipid profile. Overproduction of {VLDL} leads to increased plasma levels of {TG} which, via an exchange process mediated by cholesterol ester transfer protein ({CETP}), results in low levels of high density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, and the generation of small, dense, cholesterol ester depleted low density lipoproteins ({LDL}). Increased assembly and secretion of {VLDL} by the liver results from the complex, post-transcriptional regulation of apolipoprotein B ({apoB}) metabolism in the liver. In the presence of low levels of hepatic {TG} and cholesterol, much of the constitutively synthesized {apoB} is degraded by both proteasomal and non-proteasomal pathways. When excess {TG}, and to a lesser extent, cholesterol, are present, and in the presence of active microsomal triglycerides transfer protein, {apoB} is targeted for secretion. The major sources of {TG} in the liver: uptake of fatty acids ({FA}) released by lipolysis of adipose tissue {TG}, uptake of {TGFA} in {VLDL} and chylomicrons remnants, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (the synthesis of {FA} from glucose) are all abnormally increased in insulin resistance. Treatment of the dyslipidemia in insulin resistant individuals and patients with T2DM has been successful in reducing cardiovascular disease; {LDL} cholesterol, {TG}, and {HDL} cholesterol are all appropriate targets for therapy when diet, exercise, and weight loss do not achieve goals.},

One proposal for boosting reverse cholesterol transport has been to elevate plasma {HDL} levels by inhibiting {CE} transfer protein ({CETP}), which transfers {CE} from {HDL} to lower-density lipoproteins. However, there has been concern that large, {CE}-rich {HDL}2 generated by {CETP} inhibition might impair reverse cholesterol transport. {ApoE} uniquely facilitates reverse cholesterol transport by allowing {CE}-rich core expansion in {HDL}. In lower species, these large {HDLs} are not atherogenic.

Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient {ATP} production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

In this review, the different genetic and biochemical mechanisms by which tumor cells achieve an enhanced glycolytic flux are analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed mechanisms that arguably lead to a decreased oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells are discussed. As the O(2) concentration in hypoxic regions of tumors seems not to be limiting for the functioning of oxidative phosphorylation, this pathway is re-evaluated regarding oxidizable substrate utilization and its contribution to {ATP} supply versus glycolysis. In the tumor cell lines where the oxidative metabolism prevails over the glycolytic metabolism for {ATP} supply, the flux control distribution of both pathways is described. The effect of glycolytic and mitochondrial drugs on tumor energy metabolism and cellular proliferation is described and discussed. Similarly, the energy metabolic changes associated with inherent and acquired resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy of tumor cells, and those determined by positron emission tomography, are revised. It is proposed that energy metabolism may be an alternative therapeutic target for both hypoxic (glycolytic) and oxidative tumors.},

This persistence of high lactate production by tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago. How tumour cells establish this altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase. Here we use short hairpin {RNA} to knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2 expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.},

	abstract = {The fatty acid synthase ({FAS}) gene is significantly up-regulated in various types of cancers, and blocking the {FAS} expression results in apoptosis of tumor cells. Therefore, {FAS} is considered to be an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanism by which the {FAS} gene is up-regulated in tumor cells is poorly understood. We found that {FAS} was significantly up-regulated by hypoxia, which was also accompanied by reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) generation in human breast cancer cell lines. The {FAS} expression was also activated by H(2)O(2), whereas N-acetyl-L-cystein, a {ROS} inhibitor, suppressed the expression. We also found that the hypoxia significantly up-regulated sterol regulatory-element binding protein ({SREBP})-1, the major transcriptional regulator of the {FAS} gene, via phosphorylation of Akt followed by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ({HIF}1). Moreover, our results of reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicate that {SREBP}-1 strongly bound to the {SREBP} binding site/E-box sequence on the {FAS} promoter under hypoxia. In our xenograft mouse model, {FAS} was strongly expressed in the hypoxic regions of the tumor. In addition, our results of immunohistochemical analysis for human breast tumor specimens indicate that the expressions of both {FAS} and {SREBP}-1 were colocalized with hypoxic regions in the tumors. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to cyclophosphamide was partially blocked by a combination of {FAS} inhibitor and cyclophosphamide. Taken together, our results indicate that {FAS} gene is up-regulated by hypoxia via activation of the Akt and {HIF}1 followed by the induction of the {SREBP}-1 gene, and that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is partly due to the up-regulation of {FAS}.},

	abstract = {The hetero-trimeric {PP}2A serine/threonine phosphatases containing the regulatory subunit B56, and in particular B56γ, can function as tumor suppressors. In response to {DNA} damage, the B56γ subunit complexes with the {PP}2A {AC} core (B56γ-{PP}2A) and binds p53. This event promotes {PP}2A-mediated dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr55, which induces expression of p21, and the subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. In addition to dephosphorylation of p53, B56γ-{PP}2A also inhibits cell proliferation and transformation by a second, as yet unknown, p53-independent mechanism. Here, we interrogated a panel of B56γ mutations found in human cancer samples and cell lines and showed that these mutations lost B56γ tumor-suppressive activity by two distinct mechanisms: one is by disrupting interactions with the {PP}2A {AC} core and the other with B56γ-{PP}2A substrates (p53 and unknown proteins). For the first mechanism, due to the absence of the C catalytic subunit in the complex, the mutants are unable to mediate dephosphorylation of any substrate and thus failed to promote both the p53-dependent and -independent tumor-suppressive functions of B56γ-{PP}2A. For the second mechanism, the mutants lacked specific substrate interactions and thus partially lost tumor-suppressive function, i.e., either the p53-dependent or p53-independent contingent upon which substrate binding was affected. Overall, these data provide new insight into the mechanisms of tumor suppression by B56γ.
{IMPLICATIONS}: This study further indicates the importance of B56γ-{PP}2A in tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {Recent data suggest that sterol regulatory-binding protein ({SREBP})-1c plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of different lipogenic genes mediating lipid synthesis as a key regulator of fuel metabolism. {SREBP}-1c regulates its downstream genes by changing its own {mRNA} level, which led us to sequence and analyze the promoter region of the mouse {SREBP}-1c gene. A cluster of putative binding sites of several transcription factors composed of an {NF}-Y site, an E-box, a sterol-regulatory element 3, and an Sp1 site were located at -90 base pairs of the {SREBP}-1c promoter. Luciferase reporter gene assays indicated that this {SRE} complex is essential to the basal promoter activity and confers responsiveness to activation by nuclear {SREBPs}. Deletion and mutation analyses suggest that the {NF}-Y site and {SRE}3 in the {SRE} complex are responsible for {SREBP} activation, although the other sites were also involved in the basal activity. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that {SREBP}-1 binds to the {SRE}3. Taken together, these findings implicate a positive loop production of {SREBP}-1c through the {SRE} complex, possibly leading to the overshoot in induction of {SREBP}-1c and its downstream genes seen in the livers of refed mice. Furthermore, reporter assays using larger upstream fragments indicated another region that was inducible by addition of sterols. The presence of the {SRE} complex and a sterol-inducible region in the same promoter suggests a novel regulatory link between cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.},

In experiment 2 the rats received the following: 1) vehicle, 2) dexamethasone, 3) dexamethasone plus arginine (2\%; as substrate of the nitric oxide synthase for nitric oxide production) in tap water, and 4) dexamethasone plus isosorbide dinitrate (70 mg/kg; as direct nitric oxide donor) in tap water. Insulin sensitivity was significantly reduced by dexamethasone already at week 1, before the increase in blood pressure (day 15) and without significant changes in body weight compared with vehicle. Dexamethasone-treated rats had significantly higher triglycerides, hematocrit, and insulin, whereas serum total nitrates/ nitrites were lower compared with vehicle. The concomitant treatment with metformin minimized all the described effects of dexamethasone. In experiment 2, only isosorbide dinitrate was able to prevent the observed dexamethasone-induced metabolic, hemodynamic, and insulin sensitivity changes. Chronic low-dose subcutaneous dexamethasone (2 microg/day) is a useful model to study the relationships between insulin resistance and blood pressure in the rat, and dexamethasone might decrease insulin sensitivity and increase blood pressure through an endothelium-mediated mechanism.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

This study presents a simple method to infer the regulation of transcription factors from microarray data based on well-characterized target genes. We generated a catalog containing transcription factors associated with 2720 target genes and 6401 experimentally validated regulations. When it was available, a distinction between transcriptional activation and inhibition was included for each regulation. Next, we built a tool (www.tfacts.org) that compares submitted gene lists with target genes in the catalog to detect regulated transcription factors. {TFactS} was validated with published lists of regulated genes in various models and compared to tools based on in silico promoter analysis. We next analyzed the {NCI}60 cancer microarray data set and showed the regulation of {SOX}10, {MITF} and {JUN} in melanomas. We then performed microarray experiments comparing gene expression response of human fibroblasts stimulated by different growth factors. {TFactS} predicted the specific activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription factors by {PDGF}-{BB}, which was confirmed experimentally. Our results show that the expression levels of transcription factor target genes constitute a robust signature for transcription factor regulation, and can be efficiently used for microarray data mining.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a disease characterized by a relative or absolute lack of insulin, leading to hyperglycaemia. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is due to an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, and type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance coupled by a failure of the beta cell to compensate. Animal models for type 1 diabetes range from animals with spontaneously developing autoimmune diabetes to chemical ablation of the pancreatic beta cells. Type 2 diabetes is modelled in both obese and non-obese animal models with varying degrees of insulin resistance and beta cell failure. This review outlines some of the models currently used in diabetes research. In addition, the use of transgenic and knock-out mouse models is discussed. Ideally, more than one animal model should be used to represent the diversity seen in human diabetic patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Until recently, the importance of hepatic de novo lipogenesis ({DNL}) in contributing to hypertriglyceridemia was difficult to assess because of methodologic limitations.
Objective: We evaluated the extent of the contribution by {DNL} to different conditions associated with hypertriglyceridemia.
Design: After 5 d of an isoenergetic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, fasting {DNL} was measured in normoinsulinemic (≤ 85 pmol/L) lean (n = 9) and obese (n = 6) and hyperinsulinemic (≥ 115 pmol/L) obese (n = 8) subjects. Fasting {DNL} was measured after a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet in normoinsulinemic lean (n = 5) and hyperinsulinemic obese (n = 5) subjects. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis was used to measure the fraction of newly synthesized fatty acids in {VLDL}-triacylglycerol.
Results: With the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, hyperinsulinemic obese subjects had a 3.7–5.3-fold higher fractional {DNL} (8.5 ± 0.7\%) than did normoinsulinemic lean (1.6 ± 0.5\%) or obese (2.3 ± 0.3\%) subjects. With the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, normoinsulinemic lean and hyperinsulinemic obese subjects had similarly high fractional {DNL} (13 ± 5.1\% and 12.8 ± 1.4\%, respectively). Compared with baseline, consumption of the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet did not affect triacylglycerol concentrations. However, after the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, triacylglycerols increased significantly and {DNL} was 5–6-fold higher than in normoinsulinemic subjects consuming a high-fat diet. The increase in triacylglycerol after the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet was correlated with fractional {DNL} (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating that subjects with high {DNL} had the greatest increase in triacylglycerols.
Conclusions: These results support the concept that both hyperinsulinemia and a low-fat diet increase {DNL}, and that {DNL} contributes to hypertriglyceridemia.},

It has been reported in {\textgreater}500 publications, 20 times more frequently for the estimation of {IR} than β-cell function.
This article summarizes the physiological basis of {HOMA}, a structural model of steady-state insulin and glucose domains, constructed from physiological dose responses of glucose uptake and insulin production. Hepatic and peripheral glucose efflux and uptake were modeled to be dependent on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Decreases in β-cell function were modeled by changing the β-cell response to plasma glucose concentrations. The original {HOMA} model was described in 1985 with a formula for approximate estimation. The computer model is available but has not been as widely used as the approximation formulae. {HOMA} has been validated against a variety of physiological methods.
We review the use and reporting of {HOMA} in the literature and give guidance on its appropriate use (e.g., cohort and epidemiological studies) and inappropriate use (e.g., measuring β-cell function in isolation). The {HOMA} model compares favorably with other models and has the advantage of requiring only a single plasma sample assayed for insulin and glucose.
In conclusion, the {HOMA} model has become a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool and, when used appropriately, it can yield valuable data. However, as with all models, the primary input data need to be robust, and the data need to be interpreted carefully.},

Considering there are potentially seven points within a 24-hour glucose profile (pre-meals, post-meals, and at bedtime), the question of which of these values to target is important to both patients and busy practitioners. Appropriate targeting of plasma glucose may lead to less expense and less unnecessary testing for patients and may help patients and practitioners achieve glucose goals more expeditiously.

In terms of biodistribution, {siRNAs} after intravenous administration of cationic lipoplexes were largely observed in the lungs, but those of {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes were in both the liver and the kidneys, indicating that {siRNA} might be partially released from the anionic polymer-coated lipoplexes in the blood circulation and accumulate in the kidney, although the lipoplexes can prevent the agglutination with blood components. To increase the association between {siRNA} and cationic liposome, we used cholesterol-modified {siRNA} ({siRNA}-Chol) for preparation of the lipoplexes. When {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes of {siRNA}-Chol were injected into mice, {siRNA}-Chol was mainly observed in the liver, not in the kidneys. In terms of the suppression of gene expression in vivo, apolipoprotein B ({ApoB}) {mRNA} in the liver was significantly reduced 48 h after single intravenous injection of {PGA}-coated lipoplex of {ApoB} {siRNA}-Chol (2.5 mg {siRNA}/kg), but not cationic, {CS}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes. In terms of toxicity after intravenous injection, {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes did not increase {GOT} and {GPT} concentrations in blood. From these findings, {PGA} coatings for cationic lipoplex of {siRNA}-Chol might produce a systemic vector of {siRNA} to the liver.},

We used these engineered Cas9 activation complexes to investigate single-guide {RNA} ({sgRNA}) targeting rules for effective transcriptional activation, to demonstrate multiplexed activation of ten genes simultaneously, and to upregulate long intergenic non-coding {RNA} ({lincRNA}) transcripts. We also synthesized a library consisting of 70,290 guides targeting all human {RefSeq} coding isoforms to screen for genes that, upon activation, confer resistance to a {BRAF} inhibitor. The top hits included genes previously shown to be able to confer resistance, and novel candidates were validated using individual {sgRNA} and complementary {DNA} overexpression. A gene signature based on the top screening hits correlated with a gene expression signature of {BRAF} inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived samples. These results collectively demonstrate the potential of Cas9-based activators as a powerful genetic perturbation technology.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to cirrhosis. The hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is hepatocyte accumulation of triglycerides. We will review the role of triglyceride synthesis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progression and summarize recent findings about triglyceride synthesis inhibition and prevention of progressive disease.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Attempts to inhibit triglyceride synthesis in animal models have resulted in improvement in hepatic steatosis. Studies in animal models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease demonstrate that inhibition of acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in triglyceride synthesis, results in improvement in hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity. We recently confirmed that hepatic specific inhibition of acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase with antisense oligonucleotides improves hepatic steatosis in obese, diabetic mice but, unexpectedly, exacerbated injury and fibrosis in that model of progressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. When hepatocyte triglyceride synthesis was inhibited, free fatty acids accumulated in the liver, leading to induction of fatty acid oxidizing systems that increased hepatic oxidative stress and liver damage. These findings suggest that the ability to synthesize triglycerides may, in fact, be protective in obesity.
{SUMMARY}: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is strongly associated with obesity and peripheral insulin resistance. Peripheral insulin resistance increases lipolysis in adipose depots, promoting increased free fatty acid delivery to the liver. In states of energy excess, such as obesity, the latter normally triggers hepatic triglyceride synthesis. When hepatic triglyceride synthesis is unable to accommodate increased hepatocyte free fatty acid accumulation, however, lipotoxicity results. Thus, rather than being hepatotoxic, liver triglyceride accumulation is actually hepato-protective in obese, insulin-resistant individuals.},

Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 ({BSCL}2), one of the most severe lipodystrophy diseases, is caused by mutation of the Seipin gene. Seipin plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis, but its exact molecular functions are still unknown. Here, we show that Seipin physically interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-{ATPase} ({SERCA}) in both Drosophila and man. {SERCA}, an endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) calcium pump, is solely responsible for transporting cytosolic calcium into the {ER} lumen. Like {dSeipin}, {dSERCA} cell-autonomously promotes lipid storage in Drosophila fat cells. {dSeipin} affects {dSERCA} activity and modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. Adipose tissue-specific knockdown of the {ER}-to-cytosol calcium release channel ryanodine receptor ({RyR}) partially restores fat storage in {dSeipin} mutants. Our results reveal that Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat storage by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis.},

	volume = {17},

	abstract = {Hepatic glycogen is replenished during the absorptive period postprandially. This repletion is prompted partly by an increased hepatic uptake of glucose by the liver, partly by metabolite and hormonal signals in the portal vein, and partly by an increased gluconeogenic flux to glycogen (glyconeogenesis). There is some evidence that the direct formation of glycogen from glucose and that formed by gluconeogenic pathways is linked. This includes: (i) the inhibition of all glycogen synthesis, in vivo, when gluconeogenic flux is blocked by inhibitors; (ii) a dual relationship between glucose concentrations, lactate uptake by the liver and glycogen synthesis (by both pathways) which indicates that glucose sets the maximal rates of glycogen synthesis while lactate uptake determines the actual flux rate to glycogen; (iii) the decrease of both gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis by the biguanide, metformin; and (iv) correlations between increased gluconeogenesis and liver glycogen in obese patients and animal models. The degree to which the liver extracts portal glucose is not entirely agreed upon although a preponderance of evidence points to about a 5\% extraction rate, following meals, which is dependent on a stimulation of glucokinase. This enzyme may be linked to the expression of other enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway. Perivenous cells in the liver may induce additional gluconeogenesis in the periportal cells by increasing glycolytically produced lactate. A number of potential mechanisms therefore exist which could link glycogen synthesis from glucose and gluconeogenic substrate.},

By examination of the various mutant {ACCs}, we provided evidence that the effect of {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase is entirely mediated by the phosphorylation of Ser-1200 and that Ser-79 is important for 5'-{AMP}-dependent protein kinase action in vitro.},

As expected for an agent that activates {AMPK} intracellularly, {AICAR} had no effect on the basal activity of {HSL}. However, preincubation of adipocytes with {AICAR} led to a reduced response of these cells to the lipolytic agent isoprenaline. {AICAR} was also shown to profoundly inhibit lipogenesis through increased phosphorylation of acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase ({ACC}).

Recent experiments suggest such a fold-change detection feature in signaling systems in cells: a response that depends on the fold-change in the input signal, and not on its absolute level (Cohen-Saidon et al., in press; Goentoro and Kirschner, submitted; both in this volume). It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here we demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward loop (I1-{FFL}), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a repressor of the gene.The fold-change detection feature of the I1-{FFL} applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters.},

Surprisingly, few validated kinetic models of complex regulatory networks have been derived by combining models of the network components. A major bottleneck in producing such models is the difficulty of measuring in vivo rate constants for components of complex networks. We demonstrate that a simple, genetic approach to measuring rate constants in vivo produces an accurate kinetic model of the complex network that Saccharomyces cerevisiae employs to regulate the expression of genes encoding glucose transporters. The model predicts a transient pulse of transcription of {HXT}4 (but not {HXT}2 or {HXT}3) in response to addition of a small amount of glucose to cells, an outcome we observed experimentally. Our model also provides a mechanistic explanation for this result: {HXT}2–4 are governed by a type 2, incoherent feed forward regulatory loop involving the Rgt1 and Mig2 transcriptional repressors. The efficiency with which Rgt1 and Mig2 repress expression of each {HXT} gene determines which of them have a pulse of transcription in response to glucose. Finally, the model correctly predicts how lesions in the feed forward loop change the kinetics of induction of {HXT}4 expression.},

Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-{ATPase} (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. When challenged to acute cold (4 °C), Sln−/− mice were not able to maintain their core body temperature (37 °C) and developed hypothermia. Surgical ablation of brown adipose tissue and functional knockdown of Ucp1 allowed us to highlight the role of muscle in {NST}. Overexpression of Sln in the Sln-null background fully restored muscle-based thermogenesis, suggesting that Sln is the basis for Serca-mediated heat production. We show that ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1)-mediated Ca2+ leak is an important mechanism for Serca-activated heat generation. Here we present data to suggest that Sln can continue to interact with Serca in the presence of Ca2+, which can promote uncoupling of the Serca pump and cause futile cycling. We further show that loss of Sln predisposes mice to diet-induced obesity, which suggests that Sln-mediated {NST} is recruited during metabolic overload. These data collectively suggest that {SLN} is an important mediator of muscle thermogenesis and whole-body energy metabolism.},

Studies performed in a variety of cell and animal based experimental systems suggest that {NF}-{kappaB} activation is a key event early in the pathobiology of diabetes. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the molecular biology of {NF}-{kappaB} and to review evidence that implicates {NF}-{kappaB} in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its associated complications.},

	abstract = {Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) is a multimeric serine/threonine phosphatase which has multiple functions, including inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein ({MAP}) kinase pathway. Simian virus 40 small t antigen specifically inhibits {PP}2A function by binding to the {PP}2A regulatory subunit, interfering with the ability of {PP}2A to associate with its cellular substrates. We have reported that the expression of small t antigen inhibits {PP}2A association with Shc, leading to augmentation of insulin and epidermal growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation with enhanced activation of the Ras/{MAP} kinase pathway. However, the potential involvement of {PP}2A in insulin's metabolic signaling pathway is presently unknown. To assess this, we overexpressed small t antigen in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and found that the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, were enhanced both in the absence and in the presence of insulin. Furthermore, protein kinase C λ ({PKC} λ) activity was also augmented in small-t-antigen-expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Consistent with this result, both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were enhanced in these cells. In support of this result, when inhibitory anti-{PP}2A antibody was microinjected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found a twofold increase in {GLUT}4 translocation in the absence of insulin. The small-t-antigen-induced increase in Akt and {PKC} λ activities was not inhibited by wortmannin, while the ability of small t antigen to enhance glucose transport was inhibited by dominant negative Akt ({DN}-Akt) expression and Akt small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) but not by {DN}-{PKC} λ expression or {PKC} λ {siRNA}. We conclude that {PP}2A is a negative regulator of insulin's metabolic signaling pathway by promoting dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt and {PKC} λ and that most of the effects of {PP}2A to inhibit glucose transport are mediated through Akt.},

	abstract = {Mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathways constitute a large modular network that regulates a variety of physiological processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death. The function of the {ERK} pathway has been depicted as survival-promoting, in essence by opposing the proapoptotic activity of the stress-activated c-Jun {NH}2-terminal kinase ({JNK})/p38 {MAPK} pathways. However, recently published work suggests that extracellular regulated kinase ({ERK}) pathway activity is suppressed by {JNK}/p38 kinases during apoptosis induction. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge about {JNK}/p38-mediated mechanisms that negatively regulate the {ERK} pathway. In particular, we will focus on phosphatases ({PP}2A, {MKPs}) as inhibitors of {ERK} pathway activity in regulating apoptosis. A model proposed in this review places the negative regulation of the {ERK} pathway in a central position for the cellular decision-making process that determines whether cells will live or die in response to apoptosis-promoting signals. In addition, we will discuss the potential functional relevance of negative regulation of {ERK} pathway activity, for physiological and pathological conditions (e.g., cellular transformation).—Junttila, M.R., Li, S.-P., Westermarck, J.
