	abstract = {We have previously shown that exposure of C57BL/6J mice to intermittent hypoxia ({IH}) leads to 1) hypertriglyceridemia due to upregulation of pathways of lipid biosynthesis, including sterol regulatory element binding protein ({SREBP})-1 and stearoyl {CoA} desaturase ({SCD})-1; and 2) hypercholesterolemia due to impaired cholesterol uptake. The goal of the present study was to examine whether hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF})-1 is implicated in changes in lipid metabolism induced by {IH}. Lean {HIF}-1α (Hif1a)+/− mice, which are heterozygous for a null allele at the locus encoding the {HIF}-1α subunit, and their wild-type ({WT}) Hif1a+/+ littermates were exposed to {IH} or control conditions for 5 days. {IH} increased fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides ({TG}), and leptin in mice of both genotypes, whereas serum insulin and interleukin-6 were elevated only in {WT} mice. The impact of {IH} on serum {TG} levels in {WT} mice was significantly greater than that in Hif1a+/− mice (95 ± 9 vs. 66 ± 6 mg/dl, P {\textless} 0.05), whereas cholesterol and glucose levels were affected independently of genotype. Under hypoxic conditions, {mRNA} and protein levels of {SREBP} cleavage-activating protein ({SCAP}) and {SCD}-1 and protein levels of nuclear isoform of {SREBP}-1 in the liver were induced to significantly higher levels in {WT} mice than in Hif1a+/− mice. We conclude that 1) the effect of {IH} on serum {TG} levels is mediated through {HIF}-1, 2) {HIF}-1 may impact on posttranscriptional regulation of {SREBP}-1, and 3) the effect of {IH} on serum cholesterol levels was not altered by partial {HIF}-1α deficiency.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea, a syndrome leading to recurrent intermittent hypoxia ({IH}), has been associated previously with hypercholesterolemia, independent of underlying obesity. We examined the effects of experimentally induced {IH} on serum lipid levels and pathways of lipid metabolism in the absence and presence of obesity. Lean C57BL/6J mice and leptin-deficient obese C57BL/6J-Lepob mice were exposed to {IH} for five days to determine changes in serum lipid profile, liver lipid content, and expression of key hepatic genes of lipid metabolism. In lean mice, exposure to {IH} increased fasting serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol, phospholipids ({PLs}), and triglycerides ({TGs}), as well as liver {TG} content. These changes were not observed in obese mice, which had hyperlipidemia and fatty liver at baseline. In lean mice, {IH} increased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 ({SREBP}-1) levels in the liver, increased {mRNA} and protein levels of stearoyl–coenzyme A desaturase 1 ({SCD}-1), an important gene of {TG} and {PL} biosynthesis controlled by {SREBP}-1, and increased monounsaturated fatty acid content in serum, which indicated augmented {SCD}-1 activity. In addition, in lean mice, {IH} decreased protein levels of scavenger receptor B1, regulating uptake of cholesterol esters and {HDL} by the liver. We conclude that exposure to {IH} for five days increases serum cholesterol and {PL} levels, upregulates pathways of {TG} and {PL} biosynthesis, and inhibits pathways of cholesterol uptake in the liver in the lean state but does not exacerbate the pre-existing hyperlipidemia and metabolic disturbances in leptin-deficient obesity.},

	abstract = {Chronic alcohol causes hepatic steatosis and liver hypoxia. Hypoxia-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, ({HIF}-1α) may regulate liporegulatory genes, but the relationship of {HIF}-1 to steatosis remains unknown. We investigated {HIF}-1α in alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Alcohol administration resulted in steatosis, increased liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase ({ALT}) levels, suggesting liver injury in wild-type ({WT}) mice. There was increased hepatic {HIF}-1α messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}), protein, and {DNA}-binding activity in alcohol-fed mice compared with controls. Mice engineered with hepatocyte-specific {HIF}-1 activation ({HIF}1dPA) had increased {HIF}-1α {mRNA}, protein, and {DNA}-binding activity, and alcohol feeding in {HIF}1dPA mice increased hepatomegaly and hepatic triglyceride compared with {WT} mice. In contrast, hepatocyte-specific deletion of {HIF}-1α [{HIF}-1α(Hep−/−)], protected mice from alcohol- and lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced liver damage, serum {ALT} elevation, hepatomegaly, and lipid accumulation. {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−), {WT}, and {HIF}1dPA mice had equally suppressed levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α {mRNA} after chronic ethanol, whereas the {HIF} target, adipocyte differentiation-related protein, was up-regulated in {WT} mice but not {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−) ethanol-fed/{LPS}-challenged mice. The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ({MCP}-1) was cooperatively induced by alcohol feeding and {LPS} in {WT} but not {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−) mice. Using Huh7 hepatoma cells in vitro, we found that {MCP}-1 treatment induced lipid accumulation and increased {HIF}-1α protein expression as well as {DNA}-binding activity. Small interfering {RNA} inhibition of {HIF}-1α prevented {MCP}-1–induced lipid accumulation, suggesting a mechanistic role for {HIF}-1α in hepatocyte lipid accumulation. Conclusion: Alcohol feeding results in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes involving {HIF}-1α activation. The alcohol-induced chemokine {MCP}-1 triggers lipid accumulation in hepatocytes via {HIF}-1α activation, suggesting a mechanistic link between inflammation and hepatic steatosis in alcoholic liver disease.

	abstract = {Inappropriate regulation of the {PI}3-kinase/{PTEN}/Akt kinase-signalling cassette, a key downstream target of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling ({IIS}), is associated with several major human diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cancer. In Drosophila, studies have recently revealed that different subcellular pools of activated, phosphorylated Akt can modulate different {IIS}-dependent processes. For example, a specific pool of activated Akt within the cytoplasm alters aspects of lipid metabolism, a process that is misregulated in both obesity and diabetes. However, it remains unclear how this pool is regulated. Here we show that the protein phosphatase {PP}2A-B′ regulatory subunit Widerborst (Wdb), which coimmunoprecipitates with Akt in vivo, selectively modulates levels of activated Akt in the cytoplasm. It alters lipid droplet size and expression of the lipid storage perilipin-like protein {LSD}2 in the Drosophila ovary, but not in epithelial cells of the eye imaginal discs. We conclude that isoforms of {PP}2A-B′ can act as subcellular-compartment-specific regulators of {PI}3-kinase/{PTEN}/Akt kinase signalling and {IIS}, potentially providing new targets for modulating individual subcellular pools of activated Akt in insulin-linked disease.},

The insulin/{TOR} signaling pathway plays a crucial role in animal homeostasis, sensing nutrient status to regulate organismal growth and metabolism. We identify here the Drosophila B' regulatory subunit of {PP}2A ({PP}2A-B') as a novel, conserved component of the insulin pathway that specifically targets the {PP}2A holoenzyme to dephosphorylate S6K. {PP}2A-B' knockout flies have elevated S6K phosphorylation and exhibit phenotypes typical of elevated insulin signaling such as reduced total body triglycerides and reduced longevity. We show that {PP}2A-B' interacts with S6K both physically and genetically. The human homolog of {PP}2A-B', {PPP}2R5C, also counteracts S6K1 phosphorylation, indicating a conserved mechanism in mammals. Since S6K affects development of cancer and metabolic disease, our data identify {PPP}2R5C as a novel factor of potential medical relevance.},

To define the specific molecular mechanism whereby calcium can deactivate {AMPK}, activities of {AMPK} and {PP}2A were analyzed in C2C12 muscle cell cultures and skeletal muscle tissues from mutant pigs possessing the {AMPKγ}3-mutation or the ryanodine receptor ({RyR}1) calcium gating mutation, or both. C2C12 myotubes treated with calcium releasing agent (caffeine) for 10 h decreased (P \&lt; 0.05) {AICAR}-induced {AMPK} activity to control levels and this negative effect was eliminated by ryanodine receptor stabilizer, dantrolene. Interestingly, muscle from pigs with the {RyR}1 mutation and C2C12 cells administered with 10 h caffeine showed higher (P \&lt; 0.05) {PP}2A activity compared to controls. More importantly, the inhibitory effect of caffeine on {AMPK} activity was attenuated by the {PP}2A inhibitor, calyculin A or {siRNA} induced knockdown of {PP}2A.

We have previously shown that expression of the transcription factor {ARNT}/{HIF}1β is reduced in islets of humans with type 2 diabetes. We have now found that {ARNT} is also reduced in livers of diabetics. To study the functional effect of its reduction, we created mice with liver-specific ablation (L-{ARNT} {KO}) using {ARNT} {loxP} mice and adenoviral-mediated delivery of Cre. L-{ARNT} {KO} mice had normal blood glucose but increased fed insulin levels. These mice also exhibited features of type 2 diabetes with increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased lipogenic gene expression, and low serum β-hydroxybutyrate. These effects appear to be secondary to increased expression of {CCAAT}/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/{EBPα}), farnesoid X receptor ({FXR}), and sterol response element-binding protein 1c ({SREBP}-1c) and a reduction in phosphorylation of {AMPK} without changes in the expression of enzymes in ketogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, or {FGF}21. These results demonstrate that a deficiency of {ARNT} action in the liver, coupled with that in β cells, could contribute to the metabolic phenotype of human type 2 diabetes.},

The development of new tools, such as kinase assays using modified kinases or protein microarrays, enables rapid kinase substrate identification. The dynamics of specific phosphorylation events can now be monitored using mass spectrometry, single-cell analysis of flow cytometry, or fluorescent reporters. Together, these techniques are beginning to elucidate cellular processes and pathways regulated by phosphorylation, in addition to global regulatory networks.},

The regulatory ability of {PTPA} ({PTPase} activator), originally identified as a protein stimulating the phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity of {PP}2A, will also be discussed, alongside the other regulatory inputs. The use of specific {PP}2A inhibitors and molecular genetics in yeast, Drosophila and mice has revealed roles for {PP}2A in cell cycle regulation, cell morphology and development. {PP}2A also plays a prominent role in the regulation of specific signal transduction cascades, as witnessed by its presence in a number of macromolecular signalling modules, where it is often found in association with other phosphatases and kinases. Additionally, {PP}2A interacts with a substantial number of other cellular and viral proteins, which are {PP}2A substrates, target {PP}2A to different subcellular compartments or affect enzyme activity.

We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of {PTPN}22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using {PTPN}22-D195A/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of {PTPN}22. These included three novel {PTPN}22 substrates (Vav, {CD}3ϵ, and valosin containing protein) and two known substrates of {PEP}, the mouse homolog of {PTPN}22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell antigen receptor ({TCR}) ζ was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that {PTPN}22-D195A/C227S interacted directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and {TCRζ}, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native {PTPN}22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native {PTPN}22 also dephosphorylated {TCRζ} in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with {TCRζ} when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing {TCRζ} as a direct substrate of {PTPN}22.},

To investigate the role of {PP}2A catalytic activity in {MT} complex formation, we undertook a mutational analysis of the {PP}2A 36-{kDa} catalytic C subunit. Several residues likely to be involved in the dephosphorylation mechanism were identified and mutated. The resultant catalytically inactive C subunit mutants were then analyzed for their ability to associate with a cellular (B subunit) or a viral ({MT}) B-type subunit. Strikingly, while all of the inactive mutants were severely impaired in their interaction with B subunit, most of these mutants formed complexes with polyomavirus {MT}. These findings indicate a potential role for these catalytically important residues in complex formation with cellular B subunit, but not in complex formation with {MT}. Transformation-competent {MT} is known to associate with, and modulate the activity of, several cellular proteins, including pp60c-src family kinases. To determine whether association of {MT} with an active {PP}2A A-C heterodimer is necessary for subsequent association with pp60c-src, catalytically inactive C subunits were examined for their ability to form complexes containing pp60c-src in {MT}-expressing cells. Two catalytically inactive C subunit mutants that efficiently formed complexes with {MT} also formed complexes that included an active pp60c-src kinase, demonstrating that {PP}2A activity is not essential in cis in {MT} complexes for subsequent pp60c-src association.},

The serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) plays an essential role in many aspects of cellular functions and has been shown to be an important tumor suppressor. The core enzyme of {PP}2A comprises a 65 {kDa} scaffolding subunit and a 36 {kDa} catalytic subunit. Here we report the crystal structures of the {PP}2A core enzyme bound to two of its inhibitors, the tumor-inducing agents okadaic acid and microcystin-{LR}, at 2.6 and 2.8 � resolution, respectively. The catalytic subunit recognizes one end of the elongated scaffolding subunit by interacting with the conserved ridges of�{HEAT} repeats 11-15. Formation of the core enzyme forces the scaffolding subunit to undergo pronounced structural rearrangement. The scaffolding subunit exhibits considerable conformational flexibility, which is proposed to play an essential role in {PP}2A function. These structures, together with biochemical analyses, reveal significant insights into {PP}2A function and serve as a framework for deciphering the diverse roles of {PP}2A in cellular physiology.},

The aberrant accumulation of lipids in the liver (“fatty liver”) is tightly associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. Here we show that the impaired hepatic expression of transcriptional cofactor transducin beta-like ({TBL}) 1 represents a common feature of mono- and multigenic fatty liver mouse models. Indeed, the liver-specific ablation of {TBL}1 gene expression in healthy mice promoted hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis under both normal and high-fat dietary conditions. {TBL}1 deficiency resulted in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation due to impaired functional cooperation with its heterodimerization partner {TBL}-related ({TBLR}) 1 and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ({PPAR}) α. As {TBL}1 expression levels were found to also inversely correlate with liver fat content in human patients, the lack of hepatic {TBL}1/{TBLR}1 cofactor activity may represent a molecular rationale for hepatic steatosis in subjects with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.},

Consequently, inhibition of the {PP}2A phosphatase activity is one of many prerequisites for the transformation of normal human cells into cancerous cells. However, mechanisms for {PP}2A inactivation in human cancers are poorly understood. The aberrant expression of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ({CIP}2A), a recently identified endogenous {PP}2A inhibitor in malignant cells, is one such mechanism. Various independent studies have validated {CIP}2A's role in promoting tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis and senescence-inducing therapies. Notably, high {CIP}2A expression predicts poor patient prognosis in several human cancer types. Among the oncogenic proteins dephosphorylated by {PP}2A, the {MYC} oncoprotein, which is phosphorylated at serine 62, has surfaced as a marker for the oncogenic activity of {CIP}2A. The positive-feedback loop between {CIP}2A and {MYC} augments the activity of {MYC} in cancer cells. In addition, {CIP}2A promotes the phosphorylation and activity of additional oncoproteins, including E2F1 and {AKT}. However, {CIP}2A is not essential for normal mouse growth and development. These findings indicate that {CIP}2A is a novel anticancer target based on {PP}2A reactivation and inhibition of the oncogenic activity of its downstream effectors. The potential approaches and feasibility of targeting {CIP}2A are discussed here. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6548–53. ©2013 {AACR}.},

Dysregulation of this balance leads to pathophysiological states, driving diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Aberrant phosphorylation of components of the pathways that control cell growth and cell survival are particularly prevalent in cancer. One of the most studied tumor suppressors in these pathways is the lipid phosphatase {PTEN} (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), which dephosphorylates the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ({PIP}3), thus preventing activation of the oncogenic kinase {AKT} (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog). In 2005, the discovery of a family of protein phosphatases whose members directly dephosphorylate and inactivate {AKT} introduced a new negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) oncogenic pathway. Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase ({PHLPP}) isozymes comprise a novel tumor suppressor family whose two members, {PHLPP}1 and {PHLPP}2, are deleted as frequently as {PTEN} in cancers such as those of the prostate. {PHLPP} is thus a novel therapeutic target to suppress oncogenic pathways and is a potential candidate biomarker to stratify patients for the appropriate targeted therapeutics. This review discusses the role of {PHLPP} in terminating {AKT} signaling and how pharmacological intervention would impact this pathway.},

In {HepG}2 cells, the dephosphorylation of {AMPKα} under heat stress in turn caused dephosphorylation of acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two downstream targets of {AMPK}, confirming the inhibition of {AMPK} activity by heat stress. Treatment of {HepG}2 cells with phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) inhibitor okadaic acid or inhibition of {PP}2A expression by {RNA} interference efficiently reversed heat stress-induced {AMPKα} dephosphorylation, suggesting that heat stress inhibited {AMPK} through activation of {PP}2A. Heat stress- and other {HSP} inducer ({CdCl}2, celastrol, {MG}132)-induced {HSP}70 expression could be inhibited by {AICAR}, an {AMPK} specific activator. Inhibition of {AMPKα} expression by {RNA} interference reversed the inhibitory effect of {AICAR} on {HSP}70 expression under heat stress. These results indicate that {AMPK} inhibition under stress contribute to {HSP}70 expression. Mechanistic studies showed that activation of {AMPK} by {AICAR} had no effect on heat stress-induced {HSF}1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation and binding with heat response element in the promoter region of {HSP}70 gene, but significantly decreased {HSP}70 {mRNA} stability.
         
         
            Conclusions/Significance
            These results demonstrate that during heat shock response, {PP}2A mediated {AMPK} inhibition upregulates {HSP}70 expression at least partially through stabilizing its {mRNA}, which suggests a novel mechanism for {HSP} induction under stress.},

Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply {BioID} to lamin-A ({LaA}), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope ({NE}). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to {LaA} in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of {LaA} that are localized to the {NE}, as well as a new {NE}-associated protein named {SLAP}75.

	abstract = {Although aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is a hallmark of cancer, key questions, including when, how, and why cancer cells become highly glycolytic, remain less clear. For a largely unknown regulatory mechanism, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM}2) isoform is exclusively expressed in embryonic, proliferating, and tumor cells, and plays an essential role in tumor metabolism and growth. Because the receptor tyrosine kinase/{PI}3K/{AKT}/mammalian target of rapamycin ({RTK}/{PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR}) signaling cascade is a frequently altered pathway in cancer, we explored its potential role in cancer metabolism. We identified {mTOR} as a central activator of the Warburg effect by inducing {PKM}2 and other glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions. {PKM}2 level was augmented in mouse kidney tumors due to deficiency of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and consequent {mTOR} activation, and was reduced in human cancer cells by {mTOR} suppression. {mTOR} up-regulation of {PKM}2 expression was through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ({HIF}1α)-mediated transcription activation, and c-Myc–heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins ({hnRNPs})-dependent regulation of {PKM}2 gene splicing. Disruption of {PKM}2 suppressed oncogenic {mTOR}-mediated tumorigenesis. Unlike normal cells, {mTOR} hyperactive cells were more sensitive to inhibition of {mTOR} or glycolysis. Dual suppression of {mTOR} and glycolysis synergistically blunted the proliferation and tumor development of {mTOR} hyperactive cells. Even though aerobic glycolysis is not required for breach of senescence for immortalization and transformation, the frequently deregulated {mTOR} signaling during multistep oncogenic processes could contribute to the development of the Warburg effect in many cancers. Components of the {mTOR}/{HIF}1α/Myc–{hnRNPs}/{PKM}2 glycolysis signaling network could be targeted for the treatment of cancer caused by an aberrant {RTK}/{PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR} signaling pathway.},

To define the molecular mechanism involved in this differential regulation, luciferase-reporter gene assays were performed in {HepG}2 cells to compare the transactivities of nuclear {SREBP}-1a, -1c, and -2 on a battery of {SREBP}-target promoters containing sterol regulatory element ({SRE}), {SRE}-like, or E-box sequences. The results show first that cholesterogenic genes containing classic {SREs} in their promoters are strongly and efficiently activated by both {SREBP}-1a and {SREBP}-2, but not by {SREBP}-1c. Second, an E-box containing reporter gene is much less efficiently activated by {SREBP}-1a and -1c, and {SREBP}-2 was inactive in spite of its ability to bind to the E-box. Third, promoters of lipogenic enzymes containing variations of {SRE} ({SRE}-like sequences) are strongly activated by {SREBP}-1a, and only modestly and equally by both {SREBP}-1c and -2. Finally, substitution of the unique tyrosine residue within the basic helix-loop-helix ({bHLH}) portion of nuclear {SREBPs} with arginine, the conserved residue found in all other {bHLH} proteins, abolishes the transactivity of all {SREBPs} for {SRE}, and conversely results in markedly increased activity of {SREBP}-1 but not activity of {SREBP}-2 for E-boxes.
These data demonstrate the different specificity and affinity of nuclear {SREBP}-1 and -2 for different target {DNAs}, explaining a part of the mechanism behind the differential in vivo regulation of cholesterogenic and lipogenic enzymes by {SREBP}-1 and -2, respectively.},

Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

In animal mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected by shugoshin until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle microtubules. However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) associating with human shugoshin. {PP}2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with {PP}2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres. Thus, we have revealed a conserved mechanism of centromeric protection of eukaryotic chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis.},

	abstract = {Segregation of homologous maternal and paternal centromeres to opposite poles during meiosis I depends on post-replicative crossing over between homologous non-sister chromatids, which creates chiasmata and therefore bivalent chromosomes. Destruction of sister chromatid cohesion along chromosome arms due to proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Rec8 subunit by separase resolves chiasmata and thereby triggers the first meiotic division. This produces univalent chromosomes, the chromatids of which are held together by centromeric cohesin that has been protected from separase by shugoshin (Sgo1/{MEI}-S332) proteins. Here we show in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1 recruits to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). Its inactivation causes loss of centromeric cohesin at anaphase I and random segregation of sister centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of {PP}2A to chromosome arms prevents Rec8 phosphorylation and hinders resolution of chiasmata. Our data are consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by {PP}2A at meiosis I centromeres.},

The present study was aimed to determine if free fatty acid inhibits the {AMP}-activated kinase ({AMPK}). Exposure of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells ({BAECs}) to palmitate (0.4 mm) but not to palmitoleic or oleic acid (0.4 mm) for 40 h significantly reduced the Thr172 phosphorylation of {AMPK}-α without altering its protein expression or the phosphorylation of {LKB}1-Ser428, a major {AMPK} kinase in {BAECs}. Further, in {LKB}1-deficient cells, palmitate suppressed {AMPK}-Thr172 implying that the inhibitory effects of palmitate on {AMPK} might be independent of {LKB}1. In contrast, 2-bromopalmitate, a non-metabolizable analog of palmitate, did not alter the phosphorylation of {AMPK} and acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase. Further, palmitate significantly increased the activity of protein phosphatase ({PP})2A. Inhibition of {PP}2A with either okadaic acid, a selective {PP}2A inhibitor, or {PP}2A small interference {RNA} abolished palmitate-induced inhibition on {AMPK}-Thr172 phosphorylation. Exposure of {BAECs} to C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable analog of ceramide, mimicked the effects of palmitate. Conversely, fumonisin B1, which selectively inhibits ceramide synthase and decreases de novo formation of ceramide, abolished the effects of palmitate on both {PP}2A and {AMPK}. Inhibition of {AMPK} in parallel with increased {PP}2A activity was founded in C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat diet ({HFD}) rich in palmitate but not in mice fed with {HFD} rich in oleate. Moreover, inhibition of {PP}2A with {PP}2A-specific {siRNA} but not scrambled {siRNA} reversed {HFD}-induced inhibition on the phosphorylation of {AMPK}-Thr172 and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ({eNOS})-Ser1177 in mice fed with high fat diets. Taken together, we conclude that palmitate inhibits the phosphorylation of both {AMPK} and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in endothelial cells via ceramide-dependent {PP}2A activation.},

Resistance to leptin and insulin are likely to play a central role in obesity; thus, blocking inhibitors of these signaling pathways could prove useful in treating this disorder. Several lines of evidence have converged on protein tyrosine-phosphatase 1B ({PTP}1B) as one of the most important negative regulators of leptin as well as insulin signaling. Therefore, {PTP}1B appears to be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of obesity. In this review, we discuss the role of {PTP}1B in leptin and insulin signaling, as well as its potential as a drug target in the treatment of obesity.},

	abstract = {The liver plays a central role in glucose homeostasis in the whole-body by responding to environmental factors including nutrients, hormones, and oxygen. In conditions of metabolic overload such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, coordinated regulation between oxygen supply and consumption has been reported to be disrupted and subsequently cause tissue hypoxia, although pathological significance of the disease-related hypoxia remains elusive. To investigate the role of tissue hypoxia in the liver on systemic glucose homeostasis, mice lacking {HIF}-1α gene, a critical component of a master regulator of hypoxic response, in hepatocytes were exposed to high fat/sucrose diet ({HFSD}). Exposure to {HFSD} for 5 weeks elicited liver hypoxia with a transient increase in {HIF}-1α protein expression in the liver of control mice. Glucose disposal was marginally impaired in control mice when challenged oral glucose tolerance test, but such impairment was enhanced in the mutant mice. This alteration was accompanied by a complete inhibition of glucokinase induction with a significant reduction of hepatic glucose uptake. Mice fed {HFSD} for 20 weeks exhibited fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, whereas these metabolic phenotypes deteriorated considerably with severe insulin resistance in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues in the mutant mice. These findings suggest that {HIF}-1 in hepatocytes plays protective roles against the progression of diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {Complex cellular networks regulate regeneration, detoxification and differentiation of hepatocytes. By combining experimental data with mathematical modelling, systems biology holds great promises to elucidate the key regulatory mechanisms involved and predict targets for efficient intervention. For the generation of high-quality quantitative data suitable for mathematical modelling a standardised in vitro system is essential. Therefore the authors developed standard operating procedures for the preparation and cultivation of primary mouse hepatocytes. To reliably monitor the dynamic induction of signalling pathways, the authors established starvation conditions and evaluated the extent of starvation-associated stress by quantifying several metabolic functions of cultured primary hepatocytes, namely activities of glutathione-S-transferase, glutamine synthetase, {CYP}3A as well as secretion of lactate and urea into the culture medium. Establishment of constant metabolic activities after an initial decrease compared with freshly isolated hepatocytes showed that the cultured hepatocytes achieve a new equilibrium state that was not affected by our starving conditions. To verify the highly reproducible dynamic activation of signalling pathways in the in vitro system, the authors examined the {JAK}-{STAT}, {SMAD}, {PI}3 kinase, {MAP} kinase, {NF}-{kappaB} and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways. For the induction of gp130, {JAK}1 and {STAT}3 phosphorylation {IL}6 was used, whereas {TGFbeta} was applied to activate the phosphorylation of {SMAD}1, {SMAD}2 and {SMAD}3. Both Akt/{PKB} and {ERK}1/2 phosphorylation were stimulated by the addition of hepatocyte growth factor. The time-dependent induction of a pool of signalling competent beta-catenin was monitored in response to the inhibition of {GSK}3beta. To analyse whether phosphorylation is actually leading to transcriptional responses, luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by multiple copies of {TGFbeta}-responsive motives were applied, demonstrating a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by the {TNF}-like cytokine Fas ligand was studied in the in vitro system. Thus, the mouse hepatocyte in vitro system provides an important basis for the generation of high-quality quantitative data under standardised cell culture conditions that is essential to elucidate critical hepatocellular functions by the systems biology approach.},

	abstract = {{PTP}1B is a protein tyrosine-phosphatase located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum that plays an important role in the regulation of the insulin receptor ({IR}). Replacement of the conserved Asp-181 by alanine is known to convert {PTP}1B into a substrate-trapping protein that binds to but cannot dephosphorylate its substrates. In this work, we have studied the effect of an additional mutation (Y46F) on the substrate-trapping efficiency of {PTP}1B-D181A. We observed that this mutation converts {PTP}1B-D181A into a highly efficient substrate-trapping mutant, resulting in much higher recovery of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coimmunoprecipitated with {PTP}1B. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ({BRET}) experiments were also performed to compare the dynamics of interaction of the {IR} with these mutants. Basal {BRET}, which mainly reflects the interaction of {PTP}1B with the {IR} precursor during its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, was markedly increased with the {PTP}1B-D181A-Y46F mutant. In contrast, insulin-induced {BRET} was markedly reduced with {PTP}1B-D181A-Y46F. I125 insulin binding experiments indicated that {PTP}1B-D181-Y46F reduced the expression of {IR} at the plasma membrane. Reduced expression at the cell surface was associated with higher amounts of the uncleaved {IR} precursor in the cell. Moreover, we observed that substantial amounts of the uncleaved {IR} precursor reached the Tris-phosphorylated, fully activated form in an insulin independent fashion. These results support the notion that {PTP}1B plays a crucial role in the control of the activity of the {IR} precursor during its biosynthesis. In addition, this new substrate-trapping mutant may be a valuable tool for the identification of new {PTP}1B substrates.},

Sequence comparisons among these and previously described {AAVs} revealed the greatest divergence in capsid proteins. {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were not neutralized by heterologous antisera raised to the other serotypes. Neutralizing antibodies to {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were rare in human serum and, when present, were low in activity. Vectors formed with capsids from {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were generated by using rep and inverted terminal repeats ({ITRs}) from {AAV}2 and were compared with similarly constructed vectors made from capsids of {AAV}1, {AAV}2, and {AAV}5. Murine models of skeletal muscle and liver-directed gene transfer were used to evaluate relative vector performance. {AAV}7 vectors demonstrated efficiencies of transgene expression in skeletal muscle equivalent to that observed with {AAV}1, the most efficient known serotype for this application. In liver, transgene expression was 10- to 100-fold higher with {AAV}8 than observed with other serotypes. This improved efficiency correlated with increased persistence of vector {DNA} and higher number of transduced hepatocytes. The efficiency of {AAV}8 vector for liver-directed gene transfer of factor {IX} was not impacted by preimmunization with the other {AAV} serotypes. Vectors based on these novel, nonhuman primate {AAVs} should be considered for human gene therapy because of low reactivity to antibodies directed to human {AAVs} and because gene transfer efficiency in muscle was similar to that obtained with the best known serotype, whereas, in liver, gene transfer was substantially higher than previously described.},

	abstract = {Summary
Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A), one of the main serine–threonine phosphatases in mammalian cells, maintains cell homoeostasis by counteracting most of the kinase-driven intracellular signalling pathways. Unrestrained activation of oncogenic kinases together with inhibition of tumour suppressors is often required for development of cancer. {PP}2A has been shown to be genetically altered or functionally inactivated in many solid cancers and leukaemias, and is therefore a tumour suppressor. For example, the phosphatase activity of {PP}2A is suppressed in chronic myeloid leukaemia and other malignancies characterised by aberrant activity of oncogenic kinases. Preclinical studies show that pharmacological restoration of {PP}2A tumour-suppressor activity by {PP}2A-activating drugs (eg, {FTY}720) effectively antagonises cancer development and progression. Here, we discuss {PP}2A as a druggable tumour suppressor in view of the possible introduction of {PP}2A-activating drugs into anticancer therapeutic protocols.},

The catalytic subunit {PP}2A C is encoded by two distinct and unlinked genes, termed Cα and Cβ. The specific function of these two catalytic subunits is unknown. To address the possible redundancy between {PP}2A and related phosphatases as well as between Cα and Cβ, the Cα subunit gene was deleted by homologous recombination. Homozygous null mutant mice are embryonically lethal, demonstrating that the Cα subunit gene is an essential gene. As {PP}2A exerts a range of cellular functions including cell cycle regulation and cell fate determination, we were surprised to find that these embryos develop normally until postimplantation, around embryonic day 5.5/6.0. While no Cα protein is expressed, we find comparable expression levels of {PP}2A C at a time when the embryo is degenerating. Despite a 97\% amino acid identity, Cβ cannot completely compensate for the absence of Cα. Degenerated embryos can be recovered even at embryonic day 13.5, indicating that although embryonic tissue is still capable of proliferating, normal differentiation is significantly impaired. While the primary germ layers ectoderm and endoderm are formed, mesoderm is not formed in degenerating embryos.},

	abstract = {The alpha and beta isoforms of the human protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit are encoded by distinct genes whose expression appears to be differentially regulated. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanism(s) that regulate(s) the expression of these two transcripts, we have cloned the genes encoding both isoforms. Both genes (each approximately 30 kbp) are composed of seven exons and six introns which intervene at identical locations, suggesting that they were derived from a common ancestral gene. However, the 5' upstream regions as well as the regions encoding the 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of each {mRNA} are different. The promoters of both genes are very G+C rich and lack the {TATA} and {CCAAT} sequences typical of many housekeeping genes. The C alpha gene contains several potential Sp1 binding sites and a potential {cAMP}-responsive element. Northern analysis using {RNAs} isolated from several different human cell lines showed that the steady-state C alpha {mRNA} was, in general, more abundant than the C beta {mRNA}. To determine whether the promoters regulate the differential C alpha and C beta {RNA} expression, they were fused to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and transiently expressed in {HeLa} cells. Expression from the C alpha promoter was 7-10 times stronger than that from the C beta promoter, which paralleled the endogenous C alpha and C beta {mRNA} levels in {HeLa} cells. These data suggest that the steady-state levels of the C alpha and C beta {mRNAs}, are due, at least in part, to different promoter activities.},

A model of the A subunit was developed on the basis of the fact that uncharged or hydrophobic amino acids are conserved at eight defined positions within each repeat. Helical wheel projections suggested that each repeat can be arranged as two interacting amphipathic helixes connected by a short loop. Mutational analysis of the A subunit revealed that the proposed loops are important for binding of tumor antigens, the B subunit, and the C subunit. Native gel analysis of mutant A subunits synthesized in vitro demonstrated that the binding region for the B subunit, previously thought to include repeats 2 to 8, covers repeats 1 to 10 and that the B and C subunits cooperate in binding to the A subunit.},

Here we report for the first time that oocyte-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a led to severe female subfertility without affecting follicle survival, growth, and ovulation. {PP}2A-Aalpha was essential for regulating oocyte meiotic maturation because depletion of {PP}2A-Aalpha facilitated germinal vesicle breakdown, causing elongation of the {MII} spindle and precocious separation of sister chromatids. The resulting eggs had high risk of aneuploidy, though they could be fertilized, leading to defective embryonic development and thus subfertility. Our findings provide strong evidence that {PP}2A-Aalpha within the oocyte plays an indispensable role in oocyte meiotic maturation, though it is dispensable for folliculogenesis in the mouse ovary.},

Aα mutations were discovered in a variety of human carcinomas. All carcinoma-associated mutant Aα subunits are defective in binding the B or B and C subunits. Here we describe two knock-in mice expressing cancer-associated Aα point mutants defective in binding B' subunits, one knockout mouse expressing truncated Aα defective in B and C subunit binding, and a floxed mouse for generating conditional Aα knockouts. We found that the cancer-associated Aα mutations increased the incidence of cancer by 50 to 60\% in lungs of {FVB} mice treated with benzopyrene, demonstrating that {PP}2A acts as a tumor suppressor. We show that the effect of Aα mutation on cancer incidence is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53. The finding that the Aα mutation E64D, which was detected in a human lung carcinoma, increases the lung cancer incidence in mice suggests that this mutation also played a role in the development of the carcinoma in which it was discovered.},

This association depends on the kinase activity of the type I receptor, is increased by coexpression of the type {II} receptor, which is known to phosphorylate and activate the type I receptor, and allows the type I receptor to phosphorylate Balpha.

In this study we report the cloning and expression of a new family of B-subunit, the B', associated with the {PP}2A0 form. Polymerase chain reactions and {cDNA} library screening have identified at least seven {cDNA} isotypes, designated alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, beta 4, gamma, and delta. The different beta subtypes appear to be generated by alternative splicing. The deduced amino acid sequences of the alpha, beta 2, beta 3, beta 4 and gamma isoforms predict molecular weights of 57,600, 56,500, 60,900, 52,500, and 68,000, respectively. The proteins are 60-80\% identical and differ mostly at their termini. Two of the isoforms, B' beta 3 and B' gamma, contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal in their {COOH} terminus. No homology was found with other B- or B- related subunits. Northern analyses indicate a tissue-specific expression of the isoforms. Expression of B' alpha protein in Escherichia coli generated a polypeptide of approximately 53 {kDa}, similar to the size of the B' subunit present in the purified {PP}2A0. The recombinant protein was recognized by antibody raised against native B' and interacted with the dimeric {PP}2A (A.C2) to generate a trimeric phosphatase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the B' isoforms show significant homology to mammalian, fungal, and plant nucleotide sequences of unknown function present in the data bases. Notably, a high degree of homology (55-66\%) was found with a yeast gene, {RTS}1, encoding a multicopy suppressor of a rox3 mutant. Our data indicate that at least seven B' subunit isoforms may participate in the generation of a large number of {PP}2A0 holoenzymes that may be spatially and/or functionally targeted to different cellular processes.},

	abstract = {Differential association of regulatory B subunits with a core heterodimer, composed of a catalytic (C) and a structural (A) subunit, is an important mechanism that regulates protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). We have isolated and characterized three novel {cDNAs} related to the B' subunit of bovine cardiac {PP}2A. Two human (B'alpha1 and B'alpha2) and a mouse (B'alpha3) {cDNA} encode for alternatively spliced variants of the B subunit. The deduced primary sequences of these clones contain 12 of 15 peptides derived from the purified bovine B' subunit. Differences between the deduced sequences of the B alpha splice variants and the cardiac peptide sequences suggest the existence of multiple isoforms of the B' subunit. Comparison of the protein and nucleotide sequences of the cloned {cDNAs} show that all three forms of B'alpha diverge at a common splice site near the 3'-end of the coding regions. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that the B'alpha transcripts (4.3-4.4 kb) are widely expressed and very abundant in heart and skeletal muscle. The expressed human and mouse B'alpha proteins readily associated with the {PP}2A core enzyme in both in vitro and in vivo complex formation assays. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that epitope-tagged B'alpha was localized in both the cytosol and nuclei of transiently transfected cells. The efficiency of binding of all three expressed proteins to a glutathione S-transferase-A subunit fusion protein was greatly enhanced by the addition of the C subunit. Expression of the B'alpha subunits in insect Sf9 cells resulted in formation of {AC}.B'alpha heterotrimers with the endogenous insect A and C subunits. These results show that the B' subunit, which is the predominant regulatory subunit in cardiac {PP}2A, is a novel protein whose sequence is unrelated to other {PP}2A regulatory subunits. The nuclear localization of expressed B'alpha suggests that some variants of the B' subunit are involved in the nuclear functions of {PP}2A.},

The clones isolated from the heart {cDNA} library revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 {kDa}. All the peptides sequenced from the protein matched with the sequence predicted from the {cDNA}. However, in vitro transcription and translation from this {cDNA} yielded a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 {kDa} on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. From brain we isolated {cDNA} clones spanning an open reading frame encoding a 130-{kDa} protein (termed {PR}130). The apparent molecular mass of the protein produced by in vitro transcription and translation was 130 {kDa}. This protein has exactly the same deduced C-terminal protein sequence as the {PR}72 subunit from amino acids 45 to 527 but has an N-terminal extension of 665 amino acids. It is likely, therefore, that these two proteins arise from the same gene by alternative splicing. In human tissues several transcripts were detected by Northern analysis generated probably by the use of different polyadenylation signals and alternative splicing.

	abstract = {The proteins of the retinoblastoma family are potent inhibitors of cell cycle progression. It is well documented that their growth-inhibitory activity can be abolished by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues by cyclin dependent kinases. In contrast, very little is known about the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma-family proteins. We report here the isolation, by virtue of its ability to associate with p107, of a novel Protein Phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) regulatory subunit, named {PR}59. {PR}59 shares sequence homology with a known regulatory subunit of {PP}2A, {PR}72, but differs from {PR}72 in its expression pattern and its functional properties. We show that {PR}59 co-immunoprecipitates with the {PP}2A catalytic subunit, indicating that {PR}59 is a genuine component of {PP}2A holo-enzymes. In vivo, {PR}59 associates specifically with p107, but not with {pRb}. Elevated expression of {PR}59 results in dephosphorylation of p107, but not of {pRb}, and inhibits cell proliferation by causing cells to accumulate in G1. These data support a model in which the distinct {PP}2A regulatory subunits act to target the {PP}2A catalytic subunit to specific substrates and suggest a role for {PP}2A in regulation of p107.},

We have identified two calmodulin ({CaM})-binding proteins that form stable complexes with the {PP}2A A/C heterodimer and may represent a novel family of {PP}2A B-type subunits. These two proteins, striatin and S/G(2) nuclear autoantigen ({SG}2NA), are highly related {WD}40 repeat proteins of previously unknown function and distinct subcellular localizations. Striatin has been reported to associate with the post-synaptic densities of neurons, whereas {SG}2NA has been reported to be a nuclear protein expressed primarily during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle. We show that {SG}2NA, like striatin, binds to {CaM} in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In addition to {CaM} and {PP}2A, several unidentified proteins stably associate with the striatin-{PP}2A and {SG}2NA-{PP}2A complexes. Thus, one mechanism of targeting and organizing {PP}2A with components of Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways may be through the molecular scaffolding proteins striatin and {SG}2NA.},

	abstract = {Akt is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Phosphorylation of Akt at regulatory residues Thr-308 and Ser-473 leads to its full activation. The protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) has long been known to negatively regulate Akt activity. The {PP}2A holoenzyme consists of the structural subunit (A), catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). Here we report the identification of the specific B regulatory subunit that targets the {PP}2A holoenzyme to Akt. We found endogenous association of {PP}2A {AB}55C holoenzymes with Akt by co-immunoprecipitation analyses in pro-lymphoid {FL}5.12 cells. Akt was shown to associate with ectopically expressed B55alpha subunit in {NIH}3T3 cells. The direct interaction between B55alpha subunit and Akt was confirmed using in vitro pulldown analyses. Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of B55alpha subunit significantly impaired phosphorylation at Thr-308, but to a lesser extent at Ser-473 of Akt in both {FL}5.12 and {NIH}3T3 cells. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of a subset of Akt substrates, including {FoxO}3a, was substantially decreased by B55alpha overexpression in these cells. Silencing of B55alpha expression markedly increased phosphorylation at Thr-308 but not at Ser-473 in both {FL}5.12 cells and {NIH}3T3 cells. Consistently, {PP}2A {AB}55alphaC holoenzymes preferentially dephosphorylated phospho-Thr-308 rather than phospho-Ser-473 in in vitro dephosphorylation assays. Furthermore, B55alpha overexpression retarded proliferation of {NIH}3T3 cells, and knockdown of B55alpha expression increased survival of {FL}5.12 cells upon interleukin-3 deprivation. Together, our data demonstrate that B55alpha-dependent targeting of the {PP}2A holoenzyme to Akt selectively regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 to regulate cell proliferation and survival.},

	abstract = {Wnt signaling increases beta-catenin abundance and transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Our previous work suggested that the B56 regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) inhibits Wnt signaling. Okadaic acid (a phosphatase inhibitor) increases, while B56 expression reduces, beta-catenin abundance; B56 also reduces transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Okadaic acid is a tumor promoter, and the structural A subunit of {PP}2A is mutated in multiple cancers. Taken together, the evidence suggests that {PP}2A is a tumor suppressor. However, other studies suggest that {PP}2A activates Wnt signaling. We now show that the B56, A and catalytic C subunits of {PP}2A each have ventralizing activity in Xenopus embryos. B56 was epistatically positioned downstream of {GSK}3beta and axin but upstream of beta-catenin, and axin co-immunoprecipitated B56, A and C subunits, suggesting that {PP}2A:B56 is in the beta-catenin degradation complex. {PP}2A appears to be essential for beta-catenin degradation, since beta-catenin degradation was reconstituted in phosphatase-depleted Xenopus egg extracts by {PP}2A, but not {PP}1. These results support the hypothesis that {PP}2A:B56 directly inhibits Wnt signaling and plays a role in development and carcinogenesis.},

Aberrant expression, mutations and somatic alterations of the {PP}2A scaffold and regulatory subunits have been observed in various human malignancies, including lung, breast, skin and colon cancer, highlighting its role as a 'tumor suppressor'. This review is focused on the structural complexity of serine/threonine phosphatase {PP}2A and summarizes its expression pattern in cancer. Additionally, the {PP}2A interacting and regulatory proteins and substrates are also discussed.

	issn = {1476-5586},
	abstract = {The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ({eIF}4E) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and is associated with cellular transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastatic progression. It is known that Mnks can phosphorylate {eIF}4E. Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) functions as a tumor suppressor, and it was previously suggested to regulate {eIF}4E phosphorylation. However, how {PP}2A regulates {eIF}4E phosphorylation has not been fully addressed. In this study, we have not only validated the role of {PP}2A in regulation of {eIF}4E phosphorylation but also demonstrated the mechanism underlying this process. Inhibition of {PP}2A using either okadaic acid or {PP}2A small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) increased {eIF}4E phosphorylation, which could be abolished by the presence of the Mnk inhibitor {CGP}57380 or deficiency of Mnk genes. Thus, Mnks are involved in {PP}2A-mediated regulation of {eIF}4E phosphorylation. Moreover, a dephosphorylation assay revealed that {PP}2A could directly dephosphorylate Mnk1 and {eIF}4E. m(7){GTP} pull-down assay detected more {eIF}4G and phospho-{eIF}4E and less 4EBP-1 in {PP}2A {siRNA}-transfected cells than in control {siRNA}-transfected cells, indicating an increased cap binding of {eIF}4F complex. Accordingly, okadaic acid treatment or {PP}2A knockdown increased the levels of c-Myc and Mcl-1, which are proteins known to be regulated by a cap-dependent translation mechanism. Taken together, we conclude that {PP}2A negatively regulates {eIF}4E phosphorylation and {eIF}4F complex assembly through dephosphorylation of Mnk and {eIF}4E, thus suggesting a novel mechanism by which {PP}2A exerts its tumor-suppressive function.},

Recently, advanced developments in molecular biology and high-throughput molecular analyses have revealed that many of the signaling pathways altered by gene mutations regulate cell metabolism in cancer. Furthermore, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 were shown to elevate 2-hydroxyglutarate, which led to changes in α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme activity, resulting in an increased risk of malignant tumors. Although these findings led to a renewed interest in cancer metabolism, our knowledge on the specifics of tumor metabolism is still fragmented.

	abstract = {The liver is a central organ that metabolizes excessive nutrients for storage in the form of glycogen and lipids and supplies energy-producing substrates to the peripheral tissues to maintain their function, even under starved conditions. These processes require a considerable amount of oxygen, which causes a steep oxygen gradient throughout the hepatic lobules. Alcohol consumption and/or excessive food intake can alter the hepatic metabolic balance drastically, which can precipitate fatty liver disease, a major cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis, through steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis, to liver cirrhosis. Altered hepatic metabolism and tissue remodeling in fatty liver disease further disrupt hepatic oxygen homeostasis, resulting in severe liver hypoxia. As master regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxic stress, hypoxia-inducible factors ({HIFs}) modulate various cellular and organ functions, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, metabolic demand, and cell survival, by activating their target genes during fetal development and also in many disease conditions such as cancer, heart failure, and diabetes. In the past decade, it has become clear that {HIFs} serve as key factors in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver formation. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia and {HIFs} regulate lipid metabolism in the development and progression of fatty liver disease.},

We used a “substrate-trap” technique involving a mutation in {MKP}-1 of the catalytically critical cysteine to a serine residue (“{CS}” mutant) to capture novel {MKP}-1 substrates. We transfected the {MKP}-1 ({CS}) mutant and control (wild-type, {WT}) constructs into phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ({PMA})-activated {COS}-1 cells. {MKP}-1-substrate complexes were immunoprecipitated, which yielded four bands of 17, 15, 14, and 10 {kDa} with the {CS} {MKP}-1 mutant but not the {WT} {MKP}-1. The bands were identified by mass spectrometry as histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4, respectively. Histone H3 was phosphorylated, and purified {MKP}-1 dephosphorylated histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) in vitro; whereas, histone H3 (phospho-Thr-3) was unaffected. We have previously shown that thrombin and vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) upregulated {MKP}-1 in human endothelial cells ({EC}). We now show that both thrombin and {VEGF} caused dephosphorylation of histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) and histone H3 (phospho-Thr-3) in {EC} with kinetics consistent with {MKP}-1 induction. Furthermore, {MKP}-1-specific small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) prevented {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation but had no effect on H3 (phospho-Thr-3 or Thr-11) dephosphorylation. In summary, histone H3 is a novel substrate of {MKP}-1, and {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation requires {MKP}-1. We propose that {MKP}-1-mediated H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation is a key regulatory step in {EC} activation by {VEGF} and thrombin.},

We transfected the {MKP}-1 ({CS}) mutant and control (wild-type, {WT}) constructs into phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ({PMA})-activated {COS}-1 cells. {MKP}-1-substrate complexes were immunoprecipitated, which yielded four bands of 17, 15, 14, and 10 {kDa} with the {CS} {MKP}-1 mutant but not the {WT} {MKP}-1. The bands were identified by mass spectrometry as histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4, respectively. Histone H3 was phosphorylated, and purified {MKP}-1 dephosphorylated histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) in vitro; whereas, histone H3 (phospho-Thr-3) was unaffected. We have previously shown that thrombin and vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) upregulated {MKP}-1 in human endothelial cells ({EC}). We now show that both thrombin and {VEGF} caused dephosphorylation of histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) and histone H3 (phospho-Thr-3) in {EC} with kinetics consistent with {MKP}-1 induction. Furthermore, {MKP}-1-specific small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) prevented {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation but had no effect on H3 (phospho-Thr-3 or Thr-11) dephosphorylation. In summary, histone H3 is a novel substrate of {MKP}-1, and {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation requires {MKP}-1. We propose that {MKP}-1-mediated H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation is a key regulatory step in {EC} activation by {VEGF} and thrombin.},
