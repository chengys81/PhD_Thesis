  Summary The insulin/{TOR} signaling pathway plays a crucial role in animal
  homeostasis, sensing nutrient status to regulate organismal growth and
  metabolism. We identify here the Drosophila B' regulatory subunit of {PP}2A
  ({PP}2A-B') as a novel, conserved component of the insulin pathway that
  specifically targets the {PP}2A holoenzyme to dephosphorylate S6K. {PP}2A-B'
  knockout flies have elevated S6K phosphorylation and exhibit phenotypes
  typical of elevated insulin signaling such as reduced total body
  triglycerides and reduced longevity. We show that {PP}2A-B' interacts with
  S6K both physically and genetically. The human homolog of {PP}2A-B',
  {PPP}2R5C, also counteracts S6K1 phosphorylation, indicating a conserved
  mechanism in mammals. Since S6K affects development of cancer and metabolic
  disease, our data identify {PPP}2R5C as a novel factor of potential medical
  relevance.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Protein Phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) is an important and ubiquitously expressed
  serine threonine phosphatase and regulates the function by dephosphorylating
  many critical cellular molecules like Akt, p53, c-Myc and β-catenin. It
  plays a critical role in cellular processes, such as cell proliferation,
  signal transduction and apoptosis. Structurally, it is multifarious as it is
  composed of catalytic, scaffold and regulatory subunits. The catalytic and
  scaffold subunits have two isoforms and the regulatory subunit has four
  different families containing different isoforms. The regulatory subunit is
  the most diverse with temporal and spatial specificity. {PP}2A undergoes
  post-translational modifications (i.e. phosphorylation and methylation),
  which in turn, regulates its enzymatic activity. Aberrant expression,
  mutations and somatic alterations of the {PP}2A scaffold and regulatory
  subunits have been observed in various human malignancies, including lung,
  breast, skin and colon cancer, highlighting its role as a 'tumor suppressor'.
  This review is focused on the structural complexity of serine/threonine
  phosphatase {PP}2A and summarizes its expression pattern in cancer.
  Additionally, the {PP}2A interacting and regulatory proteins and substrates
  are also discussed. Finally, the mouse models developed to understand the
  biological role of {PP}2A subunits in an in vivo model system are also
  reviewed in this article.%

  {PP}2A is one of the few serine/threonine-specific phosphatases in the cell,
  and its complex structure and regulation guarantees its many different
  functions. Some viruses have chosen to target this enzyme system in order to
  manage the host cell machinery for their own profit and to program cells into
  a malignant state. Suppression of {PR}61/B'gamma, a specific third regulatory
  subunit of {PP}2A, can substitute for the viral {SV}40 protein small t
  antigen in causing tumorigenic transformation of several human cell lines --
  provided that telomerase, {SV}40 large T antigen and oncogenic Ras are also
  present. Accumulation of c-Myc seems to be the common denominator.%

  The serine/threonine protein phosphatase ({PP}2A) is a trimeric holoenzyme
  that plays an integral role in the regulation of a number of major signaling
  pathways whose deregulation can contribute to cancer. The specificity and
  activity of {PP}2A are highly regulated through the interaction of a family
  of regulatory B subunits with the substrates. Accumulating evidence indicates
  that {PP}2A acts as a tumor suppressor. In this review we summarize the known
  effects of specific {PP}2A holoenzymes and their roles in cancer relevant
  pathways. In particular we highlight {PP}2A function in the regulation of
  {MAPK} and Wnt signaling.%

  The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during
  the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an
  organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic
  disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth
  suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
  angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these
  hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that
  expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple
  hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two
  emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of
  energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer
  cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a
  repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the
  acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.”
  Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will
  increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.%

  Cancer metabolism has long been equated with aerobic glycolysis, seen by
  early biochemists as primitive and inefficient. Despite these early beliefs,
  the metabolic signatures of cancer cells are not passive responses to damaged
  mitochondria but result from oncogene-directed metabolic reprogramming
  required to support anabolic growth. Recent evidence suggests that
  metabolites themselves can be oncogenic by altering cell signaling and
  blocking cellular differentiation. No longer can cancer-associated
  alterations in metabolism be viewed as an indirect response to cell
  proliferation and survival signals. We contend that altered metabolism has
  attained the status of a core hallmark of cancer.%

  Interest in the topic of tumour metabolism has waxed and waned over the past
  century of cancer research. The early observations of Warburg and his
  contemporaries established that there are fundamental differences in the
  central metabolic pathways operating in malignant tissue. However, the
  initial hypotheses that were based on these observations proved inadequate to
  explain tumorigenesis, and the oncogene revolution pushed tumour metabolism
  to the margins of cancer research. In recent years, interest has been renewed
  as it has become clear that many of the signalling pathways that are affected
  by genetic mutations and the tumour microenvironment have a profound effect
  on core metabolism, making this topic once again one of the most intense
  areas of research in cancer biology.%

  The hetero-trimeric {PP}2A serine/threonine phosphatases containing the
  regulatory subunit B56, and in particular B56γ, can function as tumor
  suppressors. In response to {DNA} damage, the B56γ subunit complexes with
  the {PP}2A {AC} core (B56γ-{PP}2A) and binds p53. This event promotes
  {PP}2A-mediated dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr55, which induces expression
  of p21, and the subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation and
  transformation. In addition to dephosphorylation of p53, B56γ-{PP}2A also
  inhibits cell proliferation and transformation by a second, as yet unknown,
  p53-independent mechanism. Here, we interrogated a panel of B56γ mutations
  found in human cancer samples and cell lines and showed that these mutations
  lost B56γ tumor-suppressive activity by two distinct mechanisms: one is by
  disrupting interactions with the {PP}2A {AC} core and the other with
  B56γ-{PP}2A substrates (p53 and unknown proteins). For the first mechanism,
  due to the absence of the C catalytic subunit in the complex, the mutants are
  unable to mediate dephosphorylation of any substrate and thus failed to
  promote both the p53-dependent and -independent tumor-suppressive functions
  of B56γ-{PP}2A. For the second mechanism, the mutants lacked specific
  substrate interactions and thus partially lost tumor-suppressive function,
  i.e., either the p53-dependent or p53-independent contingent upon which
  substrate binding was affected. Overall, these data provide new insight into
  the mechanisms of tumor suppression by B56γ. {IMPLICATIONS}: This study
  further indicates the importance of B56γ-{PP}2A in tumorigenesis.%

  Earlier studies have demonstrated a functional link between
  B56\{gamma\}-specific protein phosphatase 2A (B56\{gamma\}-{PP}2A) and p53
  tumor suppressor activity. Upon {DNA} damage, a complex including
  B56\{gamma\}-{PP}2A and p53 is formed which leads to Thr55 dephosphorylation
  of p53, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and the inhibition
  of cell proliferation. Although an enhanced interaction between p53 and
  B56\{gamma\} is observed after {DNA} damage, the underlying mechanism and its
  significance in {PP}2A tumor-suppressive function remain unclear. In this
  study, we show that the increased interaction between B56\{gamma\} and p53
  after {DNA} damage requires {ATM}-dependent phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15.
  In addition, we demonstrate that the B56\{gamma\}3-induced inhibition of cell
  proliferation, induction of cell cycle arrest in G1, and blockage of
  anchorage-independent growth are also dependent on Ser15 phosphorylation of
  p53 and p53-B56\{gamma\} interaction. Taken together, our results provide a
  mechanistic link between Ser15 phosphorylation-mediated p53-B56\{gamma\}
  interaction and the modulation of p53 tumor suppressor activity by {PP}2A. We
  also show an important link between {ATM} activity and the tumor-suppressive
  function of B56\{gamma\}-{PP}2A.%

  Alterations in cellular metabolism are among the most consistent hallmarks of
  cancer. Herein we have investigated the relationship between increased
  aerobic lactate production and mitochondrial physiology in tumor cells. To
  diminish the ability of malignant cells to metabolize pyruvate to lactate,
  lactate dehydrogenase A ({LDH}-A) levels were knocked down by means of
  {LDH}-A short hairpin {RNAs}. Reduction in {LDH}-A activity resulted in
  stimulation of mitochondrial respiration and decrease of mitochondrial
  membrane potential. It also compromised the ability of these tumor cells to
  proliferate under hypoxia. The tumorigenicity of the {LDH}-A-deficient cells
  was severely diminished, and this phenotype was reversed by complementation
  with the human ortholog {LDH}-A protein. These results demonstrate that
  {LDH}-A plays a key role in tumor maintenance.%

  In early studies on energy metabolism of tumor cells, it was proposed that
  the enhanced glycolysis was induced by a decreased oxidative phosphorylation.
  Since then it has been indiscriminately applied to all types of tumor cells
  that the {ATP} supply is mainly or only provided by glycolysis, without an
  appropriate experimental evaluation. In this review, the different genetic
  and biochemical mechanisms by which tumor cells achieve an enhanced
  glycolytic flux are analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed mechanisms that
  arguably lead to a decreased oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells are
  discussed. As the O(2) concentration in hypoxic regions of tumors seems not
  to be limiting for the functioning of oxidative phosphorylation, this pathway
  is re-evaluated regarding oxidizable substrate utilization and its
  contribution to {ATP} supply versus glycolysis. In the tumor cell lines where
  the oxidative metabolism prevails over the glycolytic metabolism for {ATP}
  supply, the flux control distribution of both pathways is described. The
  effect of glycolytic and mitochondrial drugs on tumor energy metabolism and
  cellular proliferation is described and discussed. Similarly, the energy
  metabolic changes associated with inherent and acquired resistance to
  radiotherapy and chemotherapy of tumor cells, and those determined by
  positron emission tomography, are revised. It is proposed that energy
  metabolism may be an alternative therapeutic target for both hypoxic
  (glycolytic) and oxidative tumors.%

  In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on
  mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for
  cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a
  phenomenon termed “the Warburg effect.” Aerobic glycolysis is an
  inefficient way to generate adenosine 5′-triphosphate ({ATP}), however, and
  the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose
  that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is
  adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the
  biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new
  cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several
  signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic
  pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain
  cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize
  nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient {ATP}
  production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular
  metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for
  human cancer.%

  Cell proliferation requires nutrients, energy, and biosynthetic activity to
  duplicate all macromolecular components during each passage through the cell
  cycle. It is therefore not surprising that metabolic activities in
  proliferating cells are fundamentally different from those in
  nonproliferating cells. This review examines the idea that several core
  fluxes, including aerobic glycolysis, de novo lipid biosynthesis, and
  glutamine-dependent anaplerosis, form a stereotyped platform supporting
  proliferation of diverse cell types. We also consider regulation of these
  fluxes by cellular mediators of signal transduction and gene expression,

  hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ({HIF}-1), and Myc, during physiologic cell

  Many tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake but reduced rates of
  oxidative phosphorylation. This persistence of high lactate production by
  tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first
  noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago. How tumour cells establish this
  altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is
  as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the
  glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular
  metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour
  cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of
  pyruvate kinase. Here we use short hairpin {RNA} to knockdown pyruvate kinase
  M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase
  M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to
  reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and
  increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to
  form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2
  expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic
  phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.%

  only those that help illustrate biochemistry's foundational principles. With
  this edition, students will encounter new information emerging from high

  genes and gene expression, and other techniques. In addition, students will
  see how contemporary biochemistry has shifted away from exploring metabolic
  pathways in isolation to focusing on interactions among pathways. They will
  also get an updated understanding of the relevance of biochemistry to the
  study of human disease (especially diabetes) as well as the important role of
  evolutionary theory in biochemical research. These extensive content changes,

  Although aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is a hallmark of cancer, key
  questions, including when, how, and why cancer cells become highly
  glycolytic, remain less clear. For a largely unknown regulatory mechanism, a
  rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 ({PKM}2) isoform is
  exclusively expressed in embryonic, proliferating, and tumor cells, and plays
  an essential role in tumor metabolism and growth. Because the receptor
  tyrosine kinase/{PI}3K/{AKT}/mammalian target of rapamycin
  ({RTK}/{PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR}) signaling cascade is a frequently altered pathway
  in cancer, we explored its potential role in cancer metabolism. We identified
  {mTOR} as a central activator of the Warburg effect by inducing {PKM}2 and
  other glycolytic enzymes under normoxic conditions. {PKM}2 level was
  augmented in mouse kidney tumors due to deficiency of tuberous sclerosis
  complex 2 and consequent {mTOR} activation, and was reduced in human cancer
  cells by {mTOR} suppression. {mTOR} up-regulation of {PKM}2 expression was
  through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ({HIF}1α)-mediated transcription
  activation, and c-Myc–heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins
  ({hnRNPs})-dependent regulation of {PKM}2 gene splicing. Disruption of {PKM}2
  suppressed oncogenic {mTOR}-mediated tumorigenesis. Unlike normal cells,
  {mTOR} hyperactive cells were more sensitive to inhibition of {mTOR} or
  glycolysis. Dual suppression of {mTOR} and glycolysis synergistically blunted
  the proliferation and tumor development of {mTOR} hyperactive cells. Even
  though aerobic glycolysis is not required for breach of senescence for
  immortalization and transformation, the frequently deregulated {mTOR}
  signaling during multistep oncogenic processes could contribute to the
  development of the Warburg effect in many cancers. Components of the
  {mTOR}/{HIF}1α/Myc–{hnRNPs}/{PKM}2 glycolysis signaling network could be
  targeted for the treatment of cancer caused by an aberrant
  {RTK}/{PI}3K/{AKT}/{mTOR} signaling pathway.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In the postprandial state, the liver takes up and stores glucose to minimize
  the fluctuation of glycemia. Elevated insulin concentrations, an increase in
  the load of glucose reaching the liver, and the oral/enteral/portal vein
  route of glucose delivery (compared with the peripheral intravenous route)
  are factors that increase the rate of net hepatic glucose uptake ({NHGU}).
  The entry of glucose into the portal vein stimulates a portal glucose signal
  that not only enhances {NHGU} but concomitantly reduces muscle glucose uptake
  to ensure appropriate partitioning of a glucose load. This coordinated
  regulation of glucose uptake is likely neurally mediated, at least in part,
  because it is not observed after total hepatic denervation. Moreover, there
  is evidence that both the sympathetic and the nitrergic innervation of the
  liver exert a tonic repression of {NHGU} that is relieved under feeding
  conditions. Further, the energy sensor 5′{AMP}-activated protein kinase
  appears to be involved in regulation of {NHGU} and glycogen storage.
  Consumption of a high-fat and high-fructose diet impairs {NHGU} and glycogen
  storage in association with a reduction in glucokinase protein and activity.
  An understanding of the impact of nutrients themselves and the route of
  nutrient delivery on liver carbohydrate metabolism is fundamental to the
  development of therapies for impaired postprandial glucoregulation.%

  Decreased skeletal muscle glucose disposal and increased endogenous glucose
  production ({EGP}) contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2
  diabetes, but the contribution of hepatic glycogen metabolism remains
  uncertain. Hepatic glycogen metabolism and {EGP} were monitored in type 2
  diabetic patients and nondiabetic volunteer control subjects ({CON}) after
  mixed meal ingestion and during hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic-somatostatin
  clamps applying 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({NMRS}) and
  variable infusion dual-tracer technique. Hepatocellular lipid ({HCL}) content
  was quantified by 1H {NMRS}. Before dinner, hepatic glycogen was lower in
  type 2 diabetic patients (227 ± 6 vs. {CON}: 275 ± 10 mmol/l liver, P
  {\textless} 0.001). After meal ingestion, net synthetic rates were 0.76 ±
  0.16 (type 2 diabetic patients) and 1.36 ± 0.15 mg · kg−1 · min−1
  ({CON}, P {\textless} 0.02), resulting in peak concentrations of 283 ± 15
  and 360 ± 11 mmol/l liver. Postprandial rates of {EGP} were ∼0.3 mg ·
  kg−1 · min−1 (30–170 min; P {\textless} 0.05 vs. {CON}) higher in type
  2 diabetic patients. Under clamp conditions, type 2 diabetic patients
  featured ∼54\% lower (P {\textless} 0.03) net hepatic glycogen synthesis
  and ∼0.5 mg · kg−1 · min−1 higher (P {\textless} 0.02) {EGP}. Hepatic
  glucose storage negatively correlated with {HCL} content (R = −0.602, P
  {\textless} 0.05). Type 2 diabetic patients exhibit 1) reduction of
  postprandial hepatic glycogen synthesis, 2) temporarily impaired suppression
  of {EGP}, and 3) no normalization of these defects by controlled
  hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Thus, impaired insulin sensitivity and/or
  chronic glucolipotoxicity in addition to the effects of an altered
  insulin-to-glucagon ratio or increased free fatty acids accounts for
  defective hepatic glycogen metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients.%

  The quantitative disposition of an intragastrically administered glucose load
  was studied in eight conscious 18-h fasted dogs using isotopic and
  arteriovenous (A-V) techniques. During the control period, the gut utilized
  25\% of the basal net hepatic glucose output (2.8 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1).
  After glucose ingestion, 80\% of the load was absorbed as glucose, 11\% was
  converted across the gut to lactate and alanine, and 4\% was oxidized to
  {CO}2. Two percent of the load remained in the gut 4 h after glucose
  administration and 3\% was unaccounted for. During the absorptive period, net
  hepatic glucose balance ({NHGB}) varied considerably (mean range = output of
  1.8 to uptake of 9.1 mg.kg-1.min-1), while endogenous hepatic glucose
  production (Ra hp) showed a consistent 80\% suppression. The total net
  hepatic glucose uptake during the absorptive period (150 +/- 10 min)
  accounted for the disposal of 24 +/- 10\% of the ingested load, and the
  amount of glucose escaping the splanchnic bed was 40 +/- 3\%. Overall {NHGB}
  correlated positively with basal arterial glucose and insulin levels and
  negatively with basal arterial glycerol and {FFA} and with peak absorptive
  arterial glucose and insulin levels. These data suggest that the hepatic
  response to an ingested glucose load depends in part on the degree of
  metabolic fast of the animal at the time of glucose ingestion; the latter may
  be a major determinant of the roles played by the tissues in glucose
  disposal.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  It is widely accepted that insufficient insulin-stimulated activation of
  muscle glycogen synthesis is one of the major components of
  non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus. Glycogen synthase, a key
  enzyme in muscle glycogen synthesis, is extensively regulated, both
  allosterically (by glucose-6-phosphate, {ATP}, and others) and covalently (by
  phosphorylation). Although glycogen synthase has been a topic of intense
  study for more than 50 years, its kinetic characterization has been
  confounded by its large number of phosphorylation states. Questions remain
  regarding the function of glycogen synthase regulation and the relative
  importance of allosteric and covalent modification in fulfilling this
  function. In this review, we consider both earlier kinetic studies and more
  recent site-directed mutagenesis and crystal structure studies in a detailed
  qualitative discussion of the effects of regulation on the kinetics of
  glycogen synthase. We propose that both allosteric and covalent modification
  of glycogen synthase may be described by a Monod–Wyman–Changeux model in
  terms of apparent changes to L, the equilibrium constant for transition
  between the T and R conformers. As, with the exception of L, all parameters
  of this model are independent of the glycogen synthase phosphorylation state,
  the need to determine kinetic parameters for all possible states is
  eliminated; only the relationship between a particular state and L must be
  established. We conclude by suggesting that renewed efforts to characterize
  the relationship between phosphorylation and the kinetics of glycogen
  synthase are essential in order to obtain a better quantitative understanding
  of the function of glycogen synthesis regulation. The model we propose may
  prove useful in this regard.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Increased plasma levels of triglycerides ({TG}) in very low density
  lipoproteins ({VLDL}) are not only common characteristics of the dyslipidemia
  associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but
  are the central pathophysiologic feature of the abnormal lipid profile.
  Overproduction of {VLDL} leads to increased plasma levels of {TG} which, via
  an exchange process mediated by cholesterol ester transfer protein ({CETP}),
  results in low levels of high density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol and
  apolipoprotein A-I, and the generation of small, dense, cholesterol ester
  depleted low density lipoproteins ({LDL}). Increased assembly and secretion
  of {VLDL} by the liver results from the complex, post-transcriptional
  regulation of apolipoprotein B ({apoB}) metabolism in the liver. In the
  presence of low levels of hepatic {TG} and cholesterol, much of the
  constitutively synthesized {apoB} is degraded by both proteasomal and
  non-proteasomal pathways. When excess {TG}, and to a lesser extent,
  cholesterol, are present, and in the presence of active microsomal
  triglycerides transfer protein, {apoB} is targeted for secretion. The major
  sources of {TG} in the liver: uptake of fatty acids ({FA}) released by
  lipolysis of adipose tissue {TG}, uptake of {TGFA} in {VLDL} and chylomicrons
  remnants, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (the synthesis of {FA} from
  glucose) are all abnormally increased in insulin resistance. Treatment of the
  dyslipidemia in insulin resistant individuals and patients with T2DM has been
  successful in reducing cardiovascular disease; {LDL} cholesterol, {TG}, and
  {HDL} cholesterol are all appropriate targets for therapy when diet,
  exercise, and weight loss do not achieve goals.%

  To avoid toxic overload of cholesterol in peripheral cells, the reverse
  cholesterol transport pathway directs excess cholesterol through {HDL}
  acceptors to the liver for elimination. In this issue of the {JCI}, a study
  by Matsuura et al. reveals new features of this pathway, including the
  importance of the {ATP}-binding cassette transporter G1 in macrophages and
  {apoE} in cholesteryl efflux from cells to cholesterol ester–rich
  ({CE}-rich) {HDL}2 acceptors (see the related article beginning on page
  1435). One proposal for boosting reverse cholesterol transport has been to
  elevate plasma {HDL} levels by inhibiting {CE} transfer protein ({CETP}),
  which transfers {CE} from {HDL} to lower-density lipoproteins. However, there
  has been concern that large, {CE}-rich {HDL}2 generated by {CETP} inhibition
  might impair reverse cholesterol transport. {ApoE} uniquely facilitates
  reverse cholesterol transport by allowing {CE}-rich core expansion in {HDL}.
  In lower species, these large {HDLs} are not atherogenic. Thus, {CETP} might
  not be essential for reverse cholesterol transport in humans, raising hope of
  using a {CETP} inhibitor to elevate {HDL} levels.%

  Cholesterol is of vital importance for the human body. It is a constituent
  for most biological membranes, it is needed for the formation of bile salts,
  and it is the precursor for steroid hormones and vitamin D. However, the
  presence of excess cholesterol in cells, and in particular in macrophages in
  the arterial vessel wall, might be harmful. The accumulation of cholesterol
  in arteries can lead to atherosclerosis, and in turn, to other cardiovascular
  diseases. The route that is primarily thought to be responsible for the
  disposal of cholesterol is called reverse cholesterol transport ({RCT}).
  Therefore, {RCT} is seen as an interesting target for the development of
  drugs aimed at the prevention of atherosclerosis. Research on {RCT} has taken
  off in recent years. In this review, the classical concepts about {RCT} are
  discussed, together with new insights about this topic.%

  {PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a spectrum of
  diseases ranging from simple steatosis to cirrhosis. The hallmark of
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is hepatocyte accumulation of triglycerides.
  We will review the role of triglyceride synthesis in nonalcoholic fatty liver
  disease progression and summarize recent findings about triglyceride
  synthesis inhibition and prevention of progressive disease. {RECENT}
  {FINDINGS}: Attempts to inhibit triglyceride synthesis in animal models have
  resulted in improvement in hepatic steatosis. Studies in animal models of
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease demonstrate that inhibition of acyl-coenzyme
  A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in
  triglyceride synthesis, results in improvement in hepatic steatosis and
  insulin sensitivity. We recently confirmed that hepatic specific inhibition
  of acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase with antisense
  oligonucleotides improves hepatic steatosis in obese, diabetic mice but,
  unexpectedly, exacerbated injury and fibrosis in that model of progressive
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. When hepatocyte triglyceride synthesis was
  inhibited, free fatty acids accumulated in the liver, leading to induction of
  fatty acid oxidizing systems that increased hepatic oxidative stress and
  liver damage. These findings suggest that the ability to synthesize
  triglycerides may, in fact, be protective in obesity. {SUMMARY}: Nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease is strongly associated with obesity and peripheral
  insulin resistance. Peripheral insulin resistance increases lipolysis in
  adipose depots, promoting increased free fatty acid delivery to the liver. In
  states of energy excess, such as obesity, the latter normally triggers
  hepatic triglyceride synthesis. When hepatic triglyceride synthesis is unable
  to accommodate increased hepatocyte free fatty acid accumulation, however,
  lipotoxicity results. Thus, rather than being hepatotoxic, liver triglyceride
  accumulation is actually hepato-protective in obese, insulin-resistant
  individuals.%

  Summary It is widely known that the liver is a central organ in lipogenesis,
  gluconeogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. However, over the last decades, a
  variety of pathological conditions highlighted the importance of metabolic
  functions within the diseased liver. As observed in Western societies, an
  increase in the prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome promotes
  pathophysiological changes that cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  ({NAFLD}). {NAFLD} increases the susceptibility of the liver to acute liver
  injury and may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Alterations in
  insulin response, β-oxidation, lipid storage and transport, autophagy and an
  imbalance in chemokines and nuclear receptor signaling are held accountable
  for these changes. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for lipid
  accumulation in inflammation and {ER} stress in the clinical context of liver
  regeneration and hepatic carcinogenesis. This review focuses on novel
  findings related to nuclear receptor signaling – including the vitamin D
  receptor and the liver receptor homolog 1 – in hepatic lipid and glucose
  uptake, storage and metabolism in the clinical context of {NAFLD}, liver
  regeneration, and cancer.%

  The liver plays a key role in lipid metabolism. Depending on species it is,
  more or less, the hub of fatty acid synthesis and lipid circulation through
  lipoprotein synthesis. Eventually the accumulation of lipid droplets into the
  hepatocytes results in hepatic steatosis, which may develop as a consequence
  of multiple dysfunctions such as alterations in beta-oxidation, very low
  density lipoprotein secretion, and pathways involved in the synthesis of
  fatty acids. In addition an increased circulating pool of non-esterified
  fatty acid may also to be a major determinant in the pathogenesis fatty liver
  disease. This review also focuses on transcription factors such as
  sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c and peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor alpha, which promote either hepatic fatty
  acid synthesis or oxidation.%

  Peroxisomes are involved in the beta-oxidation chain shortening of long-chain
  and very-long-chain fatty acyl-{CoAs}, long-chain dicarboxylyl-{CoAs}, the
  {CoA} esters of eicosanoids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-{CoAs}, and the
  {CoA} esters of the bile acid intermediates, and in the process, they
  generate H(2)O(2). There are two complete sets of beta-oxidation enzymes
  present in peroxisomes, with each set consisting of three distinct enzymes.
  The classic {PPAR} alpha-regulated and inducible set participates in the
  beta-oxidation of straight-chain fatty acids, whereas the second noninducible
  set acts on branched-chain fatty acids. Long-chain and very-long-chain fatty
  acids are also metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 {CYP}4A omega-oxidation
  system to dicarboxylic acids that serve as substrates for peroxisomal
  beta-oxidation. Evidence derived from mouse models of {PPAR} alpha and
  peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiency highlights the critical importance of
  the defects in {PPAR} alpha-inducible beta-oxidation in energy metabolism and
  in the development of steatohepatitis.%

  Protein phosphorylation affects most, if not all, cellular activities in
  eukaryotes and is essential for cell proliferation and development. An
  estimated 30\% of cellular proteins are phosphorylated, representing the
  phosphoproteome, and phosphorylation can alter a protein's function,
  activity, localization and stability. Recent studies for large-scale
  identification of phosphosites using mass spectrometry are revealing the
  components of the phosphoproteome. The development of new tools, such as
  kinase assays using modified kinases or protein microarrays, enables rapid
  kinase substrate identification. The dynamics of specific phosphorylation
  events can now be monitored using mass spectrometry, single-cell analysis of
  flow cytometry, or fluorescent reporters. Together, these techniques are
  beginning to elucidate cellular processes and pathways regulated by
  phosphorylation, in addition to global regulatory networks.%

  Precise control of the balance between protein phosphorylation, catalyzed by
  protein kinases, and protein dephosphorylation, catalyzed by protein
  phosphatases, is essential for cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of this
  balance leads to pathophysiological states, driving diseases such as cancer,
  heart disease, and diabetes. Aberrant phosphorylation of components of the
  pathways that control cell growth and cell survival are particularly
  prevalent in cancer. One of the most studied tumor suppressors in these
  pathways is the lipid phosphatase {PTEN} (phosphatase and tensin homolog
  deleted on chromosome ten), which dephosphorylates the lipid second messenger
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ({PIP}3), thus preventing activation
  of the oncogenic kinase {AKT} (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog).
  In 2005, the discovery of a family of protein phosphatases whose members
  directly dephosphorylate and inactivate {AKT} introduced a new negative
  regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) oncogenic pathway.
  Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase ({PHLPP})
  isozymes comprise a novel tumor suppressor family whose two members, {PHLPP}1
  and {PHLPP}2, are deleted as frequently as {PTEN} in cancers such as those of
  the prostate. {PHLPP} is thus a novel therapeutic target to suppress
  oncogenic pathways and is a potential candidate biomarker to stratify
  patients for the appropriate targeted therapeutics. This review discusses the
  role of {PHLPP} in terminating {AKT} signaling and how pharmacological
  intervention would impact this pathway.%

  Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) complexes function as tumor suppressors by
  inhibiting the activity of several critical oncogenic signaling pathways.
  Consequently, inhibition of the {PP}2A phosphatase activity is one of many
  prerequisites for the transformation of normal human cells into cancerous
  cells. However, mechanisms for {PP}2A inactivation in human cancers are
  poorly understood. The aberrant expression of cancerous inhibitor of protein
  phosphatase 2A ({CIP}2A), a recently identified endogenous {PP}2A inhibitor
  in malignant cells, is one such mechanism. Various independent studies have
  validated {CIP}2A's role in promoting tumor growth and resistance to
  apoptosis and senescence-inducing therapies. Notably, high {CIP}2A expression
  predicts poor patient prognosis in several human cancer types. Among the
  oncogenic proteins dephosphorylated by {PP}2A, the {MYC} oncoprotein, which
  is phosphorylated at serine 62, has surfaced as a marker for the oncogenic
  activity of {CIP}2A. The positive-feedback loop between {CIP}2A and {MYC}
  augments the activity of {MYC} in cancer cells. In addition, {CIP}2A promotes
  the phosphorylation and activity of additional oncoproteins, including E2F1
  and {AKT}. However, {CIP}2A is not essential for normal mouse growth and
  development. These findings indicate that {CIP}2A is a novel anticancer
  target based on {PP}2A reactivation and inhibition of the oncogenic activity
  of its downstream effectors. The potential approaches and feasibility of
  targeting {CIP}2A are discussed here. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6548–53. ©2013

  Obesity is increasing at an alarming rate and is considered by the World
  Health Organization as one of the top 10 epidemics worldwide. Resistance to
  leptin and insulin are likely to play a central role in obesity; thus,
  blocking inhibitors of these signaling pathways could prove useful in
  treating this disorder. Several lines of evidence have converged on protein
  tyrosine-phosphatase 1B ({PTP}1B) as one of the most important negative
  regulators of leptin as well as insulin signaling. Therefore, {PTP}1B appears
  to be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of obesity. In this

  Summary Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A), one of the main serine–threonine
  phosphatases in mammalian cells, maintains cell homoeostasis by counteracting
  most of the kinase-driven intracellular signalling pathways. Unrestrained
  activation of oncogenic kinases together with inhibition of tumour
  suppressors is often required for development of cancer. {PP}2A has been
  shown to be genetically altered or functionally inactivated in many solid
  cancers and leukaemias, and is therefore a tumour suppressor. For example,
  the phosphatase activity of {PP}2A is suppressed in chronic myeloid leukaemia
  and other malignancies characterised by aberrant activity of oncogenic
  kinases. Preclinical studies show that pharmacological restoration of {PP}2A
  tumour-suppressor activity by {PP}2A-activating drugs (eg, {FTY}720)
  effectively antagonises cancer development and progression. Here, we discuss
  {PP}2A as a druggable tumour suppressor in view of the possible introduction
  of {PP}2A-activating drugs into anticancer therapeutic protocols.%

  in brain and heart than in the other tissues while the distribution of
  phosphatase 1 {mRNA} showed significantly less variation. Phosphatase 2Aα
  {mRNA} was about 10 times more abundant than phosphatase 2Aβ {mRNA} in most

  The alpha and beta isoforms of the human protein phosphatase 2A catalytic
  subunit are encoded by distinct genes whose expression appears to be
  differentially regulated. To obtain a better understanding of the
  mechanism(s) that regulate(s) the expression of these two transcripts, we
  have cloned the genes encoding both isoforms. Both genes (each approximately
  30 kbp) are composed of seven exons and six introns which intervene at
  identical locations, suggesting that they were derived from a common
  ancestral gene. However, the 5' upstream regions as well as the regions
  encoding the 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of each {mRNA} are different.
  The promoters of both genes are very G+C rich and lack the {TATA} and {CCAAT}
  sequences typical of many housekeeping genes. The C alpha gene contains
  several potential Sp1 binding sites and a potential {cAMP}-responsive
  element. Northern analysis using {RNAs} isolated from several different human
  cell lines showed that the steady-state C alpha {mRNA} was, in general, more
  abundant than the C beta {mRNA}. To determine whether the promoters regulate
  the differential C alpha and C beta {RNA} expression, they were fused to the
  reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and transiently expressed in
  {HeLa} cells. Expression from the C alpha promoter was 7-10 times stronger
  than that from the C beta promoter, which paralleled the endogenous C alpha
  and C beta {mRNA} levels in {HeLa} cells. These data suggest that the
  steady-state levels of the C alpha and C beta {mRNAs}, are due, at least in
  part, to different promoter activities.%

  Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) is a multimeric enzyme, containing a
  catalytic subunit complexed with two regulatory subunits. The catalytic
  subunit {PP}2A C is encoded by two distinct and unlinked genes, termed Cα
  and Cβ. The specific function of these two catalytic subunits is unknown. To
  address the possible redundancy between {PP}2A and related phosphatases as
  well as between Cα and Cβ, the Cα subunit gene was deleted by homologous
  recombination. Homozygous null mutant mice are embryonically lethal,
  demonstrating that the Cα subunit gene is an essential gene. As {PP}2A
  exerts a range of cellular functions including cell cycle regulation and cell
  fate determination, we were surprised to find that these embryos develop
  normally until postimplantation, around embryonic day 5.5/6.0. While no Cα
  protein is expressed, we find comparable expression levels of {PP}2A C at a
  time when the embryo is degenerating. Despite a 97\% amino acid identity, Cβ
  cannot completely compensate for the absence of Cα. Degenerated embryos can
  be recovered even at embryonic day 13.5, indicating that although embryonic
  tissue is still capable of proliferating, normal differentiation is
  significantly impaired. While the primary germ layers ectoderm and endoderm
  are formed, mesoderm is not formed in degenerating embryos.%

  Protein phosphatase 2A consists of three subunits, the catalytic subunit (C)
  and two regulatory subunits (A and B). The A subunit has a rod-like shape and
  consists of 15 nonidentical repeats. It binds the catalytic subunit through
  repeats 11 to 15 at the C terminus and the tumor antigens encoded by small
  {DNA} tumor viruses through overlapping but distinct regions at N-terminal
  repeats 2 to 8. A model of the A subunit was developed on the basis of the
  fact that uncharged or hydrophobic amino acids are conserved at eight defined
  positions within each repeat. Helical wheel projections suggested that each
  repeat can be arranged as two interacting amphipathic helixes connected by a
  short loop. Mutational analysis of the A subunit revealed that the proposed
  loops are important for binding of tumor antigens, the B subunit, and the C
  subunit. Native gel analysis of mutant A subunits synthesized in vitro
  demonstrated that the binding region for the B subunit, previously thought to
  include repeats 2 to 8, covers repeats 1 to 10 and that the B and C subunits
  cooperate in binding to the A subunit.%

  Strong evidence has indicated that protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) is a tumor
  suppressor, but a mouse model for testing the tumor suppressor activity was
  missing. The most abundant forms of trimeric {PP}2A holoenzyme consist of the
  scaffolding Aα subunit, one of several regulatory B subunits, and the
  catalytic Cα subunit. Aα mutations were discovered in a variety of human
  carcinomas. All carcinoma-associated mutant Aα subunits are defective in
  binding the B or B and C subunits. Here we describe two knock-in mice
  expressing cancer-associated Aα point mutants defective in binding B'
  subunits, one knockout mouse expressing truncated Aα defective in B and C
  subunit binding, and a floxed mouse for generating conditional Aα knockouts.
  We found that the cancer-associated Aα mutations increased the incidence of
  cancer by 50 to 60\% in lungs of {FVB} mice treated with benzopyrene,
  demonstrating that {PP}2A acts as a tumor suppressor. We show that the effect
  of Aα mutation on cancer incidence is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53.
  The finding that the Aα mutation E64D, which was detected in a human lung
  carcinoma, increases the lung cancer incidence in mice suggests that this
  mutation also played a role in the development of the carcinoma in which it
  was discovered.%

  Ppp2r1a encodes the scaffold subunit Aalpha of protein phosphatase 2A
  ({PP}2A), which is an important and ubiquitously expressed serine threonine
  phosphatase family and plays a critical role in many fundamental cellular
  processes. To identify the physiological role of {PP}2A in female germ cell
  meiosis, we selectively disrupted Ppp2r1a expression in oocytes by using the
  Cre-Loxp conditional knockout system. Here we report for the first time that
  oocyte-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a led to severe female subfertility without
  affecting follicle survival, growth, and ovulation. {PP}2A-Aalpha was
  essential for regulating oocyte meiotic maturation because depletion of
  {PP}2A-Aalpha facilitated germinal vesicle breakdown, causing elongation of
  the {MII} spindle and precocious separation of sister chromatids. The
  resulting eggs had high risk of aneuploidy, though they could be fertilized,
  leading to defective embryonic development and thus subfertility. Our
  findings provide strong evidence that {PP}2A-Aalpha within the oocyte plays
  an indispensable role in oocyte meiotic maturation, though it is dispensable
  for folliculogenesis in the mouse ovary.%

  Summary The serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A)
  plays an essential role in many aspects of cellular functions and has been
  shown to be an important tumor suppressor. The core enzyme of {PP}2A
  comprises a 65 {kDa} scaffolding subunit and a 36 {kDa} catalytic subunit.
  Here we report the crystal structures of the {PP}2A core enzyme bound to two
  of its inhibitors, the tumor-inducing agents okadaic acid and
  microcystin-{LR}, at 2.6 and 2.8 � resolution, respectively. The catalytic
  subunit recognizes one end of the elongated scaffolding subunit by
  interacting with the conserved ridges of�{HEAT} repeats 11-15. Formation of
  the core enzyme forces the scaffolding subunit to undergo pronounced
  structural rearrangement. The scaffolding subunit exhibits considerable
  conformational flexibility, which is proposed to play an essential role in
  {PP}2A function. These structures, together with biochemical analyses, reveal
  significant insights into {PP}2A function and serve as a framework for
  deciphering the diverse roles of {PP}2A in cellular physiology.%

  activity of which is highly regulated. Regulation is accomplished mainly by
  members of a family of regulatory subunits, which determine the substrate
  specificity, (sub)cellular localization and catalytic activity of the {PP}2A
  holoenzymes. Moreover, the catalytic subunit is subject to two types of
  post-translational modification, phosphorylation and methylation, which are
  also thought to be important regulatory devices. The regulatory ability of
  {PTPA} ({PTPase} activator), originally identified as a protein stimulating
  the phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity of {PP}2A, will also be discussed,
  alongside the other regulatory inputs. The use of specific {PP}2A inhibitors
  and molecular genetics in yeast, Drosophila and mice has revealed roles for
  {PP}2A in cell cycle regulation, cell morphology and development. {PP}2A also
  plays a prominent role in the regulation of specific signal transduction
  cascades, as witnessed by its presence in a number of macromolecular
  signalling modules, where it is often found in association with other
  phosphatases and kinases. Additionally, {PP}2A interacts with a substantial
  number of other cellular and viral proteins, which are {PP}2A substrates,
  target {PP}2A to different subcellular compartments or affect enzyme
  activity. Finally, the de-regulation of {PP}2A in some specific pathologies
  will be touched upon.%

  Association of the catalytic subunit (C2) with a variety of regulatory
  subunits is believed to modulate the activity and specificity of protein
  phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). In this study we report the cloning and expression
  of a new family of B-subunit, the B', associated with the {PP}2A0 form.
  Polymerase chain reactions and {cDNA} library screening have identified at
  least seven {cDNA} isotypes, designated alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, beta
  4, gamma, and delta. The different beta subtypes appear to be generated by
  alternative splicing. The deduced amino acid sequences of the alpha, beta 2,
  beta 3, beta 4 and gamma isoforms predict molecular weights of 57,600,
  56,500, 60,900, 52,500, and 68,000, respectively. The proteins are 60-80\%
  identical and differ mostly at their termini. Two of the isoforms, B' beta 3
  and B' gamma, contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal in their {COOH}
  terminus. No homology was found with other B- or B- related subunits.
  Northern analyses indicate a tissue-specific expression of the isoforms.
  Expression of B' alpha protein in Escherichia coli generated a polypeptide of
  approximately 53 {kDa}, similar to the size of the B' subunit present in the
  purified {PP}2A0. The recombinant protein was recognized by antibody raised
  against native B' and interacted with the dimeric {PP}2A (A.C2) to generate a
  trimeric phosphatase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the B' isoforms
  show significant homology to mammalian, fungal, and plant nucleotide
  sequences of unknown function present in the data bases. Notably, a high
  degree of homology (55-66\%) was found with a yeast gene, {RTS}1, encoding a
  multicopy suppressor of a rox3 mutant. Our data indicate that at least seven
  B' subunit isoforms may participate in the generation of a large number of
  {PP}2A0 holoenzymes that may be spatially and/or functionally targeted to
  different cellular processes.%

  Differential association of regulatory B subunits with a core heterodimer,
  composed of a catalytic (C) and a structural (A) subunit, is an important
  mechanism that regulates protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). We have isolated
  and characterized three novel {cDNAs} related to the B' subunit of bovine
  cardiac {PP}2A. Two human (B'alpha1 and B'alpha2) and a mouse (B'alpha3)
  {cDNA} encode for alternatively spliced variants of the B subunit. The
  deduced primary sequences of these clones contain 12 of 15 peptides derived
  from the purified bovine B' subunit. Differences between the deduced
  sequences of the B alpha splice variants and the cardiac peptide sequences
  suggest the existence of multiple isoforms of the B' subunit. Comparison of
  the protein and nucleotide sequences of the cloned {cDNAs} show that all
  three forms of B'alpha diverge at a common splice site near the 3'-end of the
  coding regions. Northern blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain
  reaction analyses revealed that the B'alpha transcripts (4.3-4.4 kb) are
  widely expressed and very abundant in heart and skeletal muscle. The
  expressed human and mouse B'alpha proteins readily associated with the {PP}2A
  core enzyme in both in vitro and in vivo complex formation assays.
  Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that epitope-tagged B'alpha was
  localized in both the cytosol and nuclei of transiently transfected cells.
  The efficiency of binding of all three expressed proteins to a glutathione
  S-transferase-A subunit fusion protein was greatly enhanced by the addition
  of the C subunit. Expression of the B'alpha subunits in insect Sf9 cells
  resulted in formation of {AC}.B'alpha heterotrimers with the endogenous
  insect A and C subunits. These results show that the B' subunit, which is the
  predominant regulatory subunit in cardiac {PP}2A, is a novel protein whose
  sequence is unrelated to other {PP}2A regulatory subunits. The nuclear
  localization of expressed B'alpha suggests that some variants of the B'
  subunit are involved in the nuclear functions of {PP}2A.%

  Based on amino acid sequence data of a 74-{kDa} regulatory subunit (B" or

  The trimeric form of protein phosphatase 2A consisting of 36-, 65-, and
  72-{kDa} subunits (previously termed polycation-stimulated protein
  phosphatase M) was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. Amino acid sequence
  data of the 72-{kDa} regulatory subunit (termed {PR}72) were used to isolate
  {cDNAs} from human heart and fetal brain libraries and libraries derived from
  {WI}-38 and {MCF}-7 cells. The clones isolated from the heart {cDNA} library
  revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular
  mass of 62 {kDa}. All the peptides sequenced from the protein matched with
  the sequence predicted from the {cDNA}. However, in vitro transcription and
  translation from this {cDNA} yielded a protein with an apparent molecular
  mass of 72 {kDa} on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. From brain we
  isolated {cDNA} clones spanning an open reading frame encoding a 130-{kDa}
  protein (termed {PR}130). The apparent molecular mass of the protein produced
  by in vitro transcription and translation was 130 {kDa}. This protein has
  exactly the same deduced C-terminal protein sequence as the {PR}72 subunit
  from amino acids 45 to 527 but has an N-terminal extension of 665 amino
  acids. It is likely, therefore, that these two proteins arise from the same
  gene by alternative splicing. In human tissues several transcripts were
  detected by Northern analysis generated probably by the use of different
  polyadenylation signals and alternative splicing. High levels of the {PR}72
  {mRNAs} were detected in heart and muscle, while lower levels of {PR}130
  transcripts were found in heart, brain, placenta, lung, muscle, and kidney.%

  The proteins of the retinoblastoma family are potent inhibitors of cell cycle
  progression. It is well documented that their growth-inhibitory activity can
  be abolished by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues by cyclin
  dependent kinases. In contrast, very little is known about the
  dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma-family proteins. We report here the
  isolation, by virtue of its ability to associate with p107, of a novel
  Protein Phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) regulatory subunit, named {PR}59. {PR}59
  shares sequence homology with a known regulatory subunit of {PP}2A, {PR}72,
  but differs from {PR}72 in its expression pattern and its functional
  properties. We show that {PR}59 co-immunoprecipitates with the {PP}2A
  catalytic subunit, indicating that {PR}59 is a genuine component of {PP}2A
  holo-enzymes. In vivo, {PR}59 associates specifically with p107, but not with
  {pRb}. Elevated expression of {PR}59 results in dephosphorylation of p107,
  but not of {pRb}, and inhibits cell proliferation by causing cells to
  accumulate in G1. These data support a model in which the distinct {PP}2A
  regulatory subunits act to target the {PP}2A catalytic subunit to specific
  substrates and suggest a role for {PP}2A in regulation of p107.%

  Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) is a multifunctional serine/threonine
  phosphatase that is critical to many cellular processes including
  development, neuronal signaling, cell cycle regulation, and viral
  transformation. {PP}2A has been implicated in Ca(2+)-dependent signaling
  pathways, but how {PP}2A is targeted to these pathways is not understood. We
  have identified two calmodulin ({CaM})-binding proteins that form stable
  complexes with the {PP}2A A/C heterodimer and may represent a novel family of
  {PP}2A B-type subunits. These two proteins, striatin and S/G(2) nuclear
  autoantigen ({SG}2NA), are highly related {WD}40 repeat proteins of
  previously unknown function and distinct subcellular localizations. Striatin
  has been reported to associate with the post-synaptic densities of neurons,
  whereas {SG}2NA has been reported to be a nuclear protein expressed primarily
  during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle. We show that {SG}2NA, like
  striatin, binds to {CaM} in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In addition to {CaM}
  and {PP}2A, several unidentified proteins stably associate with the
  striatin-{PP}2A and {SG}2NA-{PP}2A complexes. Thus, one mechanism of
  targeting and organizing {PP}2A with components of Ca(2+)-dependent signaling
  pathways may be through the molecular scaffolding proteins striatin and

  \field{abstract}{%
  Inappropriate regulation of the {PI}3-kinase/{PTEN}/Akt kinase-signalling
  cassette, a key downstream target of insulin/insulin-like growth factor
  signalling ({IIS}), is associated with several major human diseases such as
  diabetes, obesity and cancer. In Drosophila, studies have recently revealed
  that different subcellular pools of activated, phosphorylated Akt can
  modulate different {IIS}-dependent processes. For example, a specific pool of
  activated Akt within the cytoplasm alters aspects of lipid metabolism, a
  process that is misregulated in both obesity and diabetes. However, it
  remains unclear how this pool is regulated. Here we show that the protein
  phosphatase {PP}2A-B′ regulatory subunit Widerborst (Wdb), which
  coimmunoprecipitates with Akt in vivo, selectively modulates levels of
  activated Akt in the cytoplasm. It alters lipid droplet size and expression
  of the lipid storage perilipin-like protein {LSD}2 in the Drosophila ovary,
  but not in epithelial cells of the eye imaginal discs. We conclude that
  isoforms of {PP}2A-B′ can act as subcellular-compartment-specific
  regulators of {PI}3-kinase/{PTEN}/Akt kinase signalling and {IIS},
  potentially providing new targets for modulating individual subcellular pools
  of activated Akt in insulin-linked disease.%

  Akt is a protein serine/threonine kinase that is involved in the regulation
  of diverse cellular processes. Phosphorylation of Akt at regulatory residues
  Thr-308 and Ser-473 leads to its full activation. The protein phosphatase 2A
  ({PP}2A) has long been known to negatively regulate Akt activity. The {PP}2A
  holoenzyme consists of the structural subunit (A), catalytic subunit (C), and
  a variable regulatory subunit (B). Here we report the identification of the
  specific B regulatory subunit that targets the {PP}2A holoenzyme to Akt. We
  found endogenous association of {PP}2A {AB}55C holoenzymes with Akt by
  co-immunoprecipitation analyses in pro-lymphoid {FL}5.12 cells. Akt was shown
  to associate with ectopically expressed B55alpha subunit in {NIH}3T3 cells.
  The direct interaction between B55alpha subunit and Akt was confirmed using
  in vitro pulldown analyses. Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of
  B55alpha subunit significantly impaired phosphorylation at Thr-308, but to a
  lesser extent at Ser-473 of Akt in both {FL}5.12 and {NIH}3T3 cells.
  Concomitantly, phosphorylation of a subset of Akt substrates, including
  {FoxO}3a, was substantially decreased by B55alpha overexpression in these
  cells. Silencing of B55alpha expression markedly increased phosphorylation at
  Thr-308 but not at Ser-473 in both {FL}5.12 cells and {NIH}3T3 cells.
  Consistently, {PP}2A {AB}55alphaC holoenzymes preferentially dephosphorylated
  phospho-Thr-308 rather than phospho-Ser-473 in in vitro dephosphorylation
  assays. Furthermore, B55alpha overexpression retarded proliferation of
  {NIH}3T3 cells, and knockdown of B55alpha expression increased survival of
  {FL}5.12 cells upon interleukin-3 deprivation. Together, our data demonstrate
  that B55alpha-dependent targeting of the {PP}2A holoenzyme to Akt selectively
  regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 to regulate cell proliferation and
  survival.%

  Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) is a multimeric serine/threonine phosphatase
  which has multiple functions, including inhibition of the mitogen-activated
  protein ({MAP}) kinase pathway. Simian virus 40 small t antigen specifically
  inhibits {PP}2A function by binding to the {PP}2A regulatory subunit,
  interfering with the ability of {PP}2A to associate with its cellular
  substrates. We have reported that the expression of small t antigen inhibits
  {PP}2A association with Shc, leading to augmentation of insulin and epidermal
  growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation with enhanced activation of the
  Ras/{MAP} kinase pathway. However, the potential involvement of {PP}2A in
  insulin's metabolic signaling pathway is presently unknown. To assess this,
  we overexpressed small t antigen in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated
  gene transfer and found that the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream
  target, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, were enhanced both in the absence and
  in the presence of insulin. Furthermore, protein kinase C λ ({PKC} λ)
  activity was also augmented in small-t-antigen-expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
  Consistent with this result, both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake
  were enhanced in these cells. In support of this result, when inhibitory
  anti-{PP}2A antibody was microinjected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found a
  twofold increase in {GLUT}4 translocation in the absence of insulin. The
  small-t-antigen-induced increase in Akt and {PKC} λ activities was not
  inhibited by wortmannin, while the ability of small t antigen to enhance
  glucose transport was inhibited by dominant negative Akt ({DN}-Akt)
  expression and Akt small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) but not by {DN}-{PKC} λ
  expression or {PKC} λ {siRNA}. We conclude that {PP}2A is a negative
  regulator of insulin's metabolic signaling pathway by promoting
  dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt and {PKC} λ and that most of the
  effects of {PP}2A to inhibit glucose transport are mediated through Akt.%

  Elevated levels of free fatty acids contribute to cardiovascular diseases,
  but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study was aimed to
  determine if free fatty acid inhibits the {AMP}-activated kinase ({AMPK}).
  Exposure of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells ({BAECs}) to palmitate
  (0.4 mm) but not to palmitoleic or oleic acid (0.4 mm) for 40 h significantly
  reduced the Thr172 phosphorylation of {AMPK}-α without altering its protein
  expression or the phosphorylation of {LKB}1-Ser428, a major {AMPK} kinase in
  {BAECs}. Further, in {LKB}1-deficient cells, palmitate suppressed
  {AMPK}-Thr172 implying that the inhibitory effects of palmitate on {AMPK}
  might be independent of {LKB}1. In contrast, 2-bromopalmitate, a
  non-metabolizable analog of palmitate, did not alter the phosphorylation of
  {AMPK} and acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase. Further, palmitate significantly
  increased the activity of protein phosphatase ({PP})2A. Inhibition of {PP}2A
  with either okadaic acid, a selective {PP}2A inhibitor, or {PP}2A small
  interference {RNA} abolished palmitate-induced inhibition on {AMPK}-Thr172
  phosphorylation. Exposure of {BAECs} to C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable analog
  of ceramide, mimicked the effects of palmitate. Conversely, fumonisin B1,
  which selectively inhibits ceramide synthase and decreases de novo formation
  of ceramide, abolished the effects of palmitate on both {PP}2A and {AMPK}.
  Inhibition of {AMPK} in parallel with increased {PP}2A activity was founded
  in C57BL/6J mice fed with high fat diet ({HFD}) rich in palmitate but not in
  mice fed with {HFD} rich in oleate. Moreover, inhibition of {PP}2A with
  {PP}2A-specific {siRNA} but not scrambled {siRNA} reversed {HFD}-induced
  inhibition on the phosphorylation of {AMPK}-Thr172 and endothelial
  nitric-oxide synthase ({eNOS})-Ser1177 in mice fed with high fat diets. Taken
  together, we conclude that palmitate inhibits the phosphorylation of both
  {AMPK} and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in endothelial cells via
  ceramide-dependent {PP}2A activation.%

  {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) is activated by upstream kinases and
  negatively regulated by protein phosphatases. Intracellular calcium mediates
  protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A), which is in a heterotrimeric complex with
  the {PR}72 subunit. The {PR}72 subunit contains two calcium-binding sites
  formed by {EF} hands. Our previous study has shown that chronic calcium
  exposure decreases {AMPK} activity. To define the specific molecular
  mechanism whereby calcium can deactivate {AMPK}, activities of {AMPK} and
  {PP}2A were analyzed in C2C12 muscle cell cultures and skeletal muscle
  tissues from mutant pigs possessing the {AMPKγ}3-mutation or the ryanodine
  receptor ({RyR}1) calcium gating mutation, or both. C2C12 myotubes treated
  with calcium releasing agent (caffeine) for 10 h decreased (P \&lt; 0.05)
  {AICAR}-induced {AMPK} activity to control levels and this negative effect
  was eliminated by ryanodine receptor stabilizer, dantrolene. Interestingly,
  muscle from pigs with the {RyR}1 mutation and C2C12 cells administered with
  10 h caffeine showed higher (P \&lt; 0.05) {PP}2A activity compared to
  controls. More importantly, the inhibitory effect of caffeine on {AMPK}
  activity was attenuated by the {PP}2A inhibitor, calyculin A or {siRNA}
  induced knockdown of {PP}2A. These data show the inhibitory effect of chronic
  calcium on {AMPK} activity is exerted through the activation of {PP}2A.%

  Background Under stress, {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) plays a
  central role in energy balance, and the heat shock response is a protective
  mechanism for cell survival. The relationship between {AMPK} activity and
  heat shock protein ({HSP}) expression under stress is unclear.
  Methodology/Principal Findings We found that heat stress induced
  dephosphorylation of {AMPKα} subunit ({AMPKα}) in various cell types from
  human and rodent. In {HepG}2 cells, the dephosphorylation of {AMPKα} under
  heat stress in turn caused dephosphorylation of acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase and
  upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two downstream targets of
  {AMPK}, confirming the inhibition of {AMPK} activity by heat stress.
  Treatment of {HepG}2 cells with phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) inhibitor okadaic
  acid or inhibition of {PP}2A expression by {RNA} interference efficiently
  reversed heat stress-induced {AMPKα} dephosphorylation, suggesting that heat
  stress inhibited {AMPK} through activation of {PP}2A. Heat stress- and other
  {HSP} inducer ({CdCl}2, celastrol, {MG}132)-induced {HSP}70 expression could
  be inhibited by {AICAR}, an {AMPK} specific activator. Inhibition of {AMPKα}
  expression by {RNA} interference reversed the inhibitory effect of {AICAR} on
  {HSP}70 expression under heat stress. These results indicate that {AMPK}
  inhibition under stress contribute to {HSP}70 expression. Mechanistic studies
  showed that activation of {AMPK} by {AICAR} had no effect on heat
  stress-induced {HSF}1 nuclear translocation, phosphorylation and binding with
  heat response element in the promoter region of {HSP}70 gene, but
  significantly decreased {HSP}70 {mRNA} stability. Conclusions/Significance
  These results demonstrate that during heat shock response, {PP}2A mediated
  {AMPK} inhibition upregulates {HSP}70 expression at least partially through
  stabilizing its {mRNA}, which suggests a novel mechanism for {HSP} induction
  under stress.%

  Wnt signaling increases beta-catenin abundance and transcription of
  Wnt-responsive genes. Our previous work suggested that the B56 regulatory
  subunit of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) inhibits Wnt signaling. Okadaic
  acid (a phosphatase inhibitor) increases, while B56 expression reduces,
  beta-catenin abundance; B56 also reduces transcription of Wnt-responsive
  genes. Okadaic acid is a tumor promoter, and the structural A subunit of
  {PP}2A is mutated in multiple cancers. Taken together, the evidence suggests
  that {PP}2A is a tumor suppressor. However, other studies suggest that {PP}2A
  activates Wnt signaling. We now show that the B56, A and catalytic C subunits
  of {PP}2A each have ventralizing activity in Xenopus embryos. B56 was
  epistatically positioned downstream of {GSK}3beta and axin but upstream of
  beta-catenin, and axin co-immunoprecipitated B56, A and C subunits,
  suggesting that {PP}2A:B56 is in the beta-catenin degradation complex. {PP}2A
  appears to be essential for beta-catenin degradation, since beta-catenin
  degradation was reconstituted in phosphatase-depleted Xenopus egg extracts by
  {PP}2A, but not {PP}1. These results support the hypothesis that {PP}2A:B56
  directly inhibits Wnt signaling and plays a role in development and
  carcinogenesis.%

  Mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathways constitute a large modular
  network that regulates a variety of physiological processes, such as cell
  growth, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death. The function of the {ERK}
  pathway has been depicted as survival-promoting, in essence by opposing the
  proapoptotic activity of the stress-activated c-Jun {NH}2-terminal kinase
  ({JNK})/p38 {MAPK} pathways. However, recently published work suggests that
  extracellular regulated kinase ({ERK}) pathway activity is suppressed by
  {JNK}/p38 kinases during apoptosis induction. In this review, we will
  summarize the current knowledge about {JNK}/p38-mediated mechanisms that
  negatively regulate the {ERK} pathway. In particular, we will focus on
  phosphatases ({PP}2A, {MKPs}) as inhibitors of {ERK} pathway activity in
  regulating apoptosis. A model proposed in this review places the negative
  regulation of the {ERK} pathway in a central position for the cellular
  decision-making process that determines whether cells will live or die in
  response to apoptosis-promoting signals. In addition, we will discuss the
  potential functional relevance of negative regulation of {ERK} pathway
  activity, for physiological and pathological conditions (e.g., cellular
  transformation).—Junttila, M.R., Li, S.-P., Westermarck, J.

  The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ({eIF}4E) is frequently
  overexpressed in human cancers and is associated with cellular
  transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastatic progression. It is known that
  Mnks can phosphorylate {eIF}4E. Protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) functions as
  a tumor suppressor, and it was previously suggested to regulate {eIF}4E
  phosphorylation. However, how {PP}2A regulates {eIF}4E phosphorylation has
  not been fully addressed. In this study, we have not only validated the role
  of {PP}2A in regulation of {eIF}4E phosphorylation but also demonstrated the
  mechanism underlying this process. Inhibition of {PP}2A using either okadaic
  acid or {PP}2A small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) increased {eIF}4E
  phosphorylation, which could be abolished by the presence of the Mnk
  inhibitor {CGP}57380 or deficiency of Mnk genes. Thus, Mnks are involved in
  {PP}2A-mediated regulation of {eIF}4E phosphorylation. Moreover, a
  dephosphorylation assay revealed that {PP}2A could directly dephosphorylate
  Mnk1 and {eIF}4E. m(7){GTP} pull-down assay detected more {eIF}4G and
  phospho-{eIF}4E and less 4EBP-1 in {PP}2A {siRNA}-transfected cells than in
  control {siRNA}-transfected cells, indicating an increased cap binding of
  {eIF}4F complex. Accordingly, okadaic acid treatment or {PP}2A knockdown
  increased the levels of c-Myc and Mcl-1, which are proteins known to be
  regulated by a cap-dependent translation mechanism. Taken together, we
  conclude that {PP}2A negatively regulates {eIF}4E phosphorylation and {eIF}4F
  complex assembly through dephosphorylation of Mnk and {eIF}4E, thus
  suggesting a novel mechanism by which {PP}2A exerts its tumor-suppressive
  function.%

  Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by a complex called cohesin, is
  crucial—particularly at centromeres—for proper chromosome segregation in
  mitosis and meiosis. In animal mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin
  promotes its dissociation from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is
  protected by shugoshin until kinetochores are properly captured by the
  spindle microtubules. However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent
  protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of
  serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) associating with human
  shugoshin. {PP}2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required
  for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to
  reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that
  dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres.
  Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with {PP}2A, with both
  proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres.
  Thus, we have revealed a conserved mechanism of centromeric protection of
  eukaryotic chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis.%

  Two subunits of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) have been shown previously to
  bind to the small t and middle T antigens ({ST} and {MT}, respectively) of
  polyomavirus. To determine sequences important for binding of {PP}2A to {ST}
  and {MT}, we first constructed a series of {ST} mutants in regions known to
  be important for biological activity of {ST} and {MT}. Several mutations in
  two small regions just amino terminal to the Cys-X-Cys-X-X-Cys motifs of {ST}
  and {MT} abolished {PP}2A binding to {ST} in vitro. Parallel mutations were
  constructed in {MT} to investigate the role of {PP}2A binding in the function
  of polyomavirus {MT}. Wild-type and mutant {MT} proteins were stably
  expressed in {NIH} 3T3 cells and analyzed (i) for their ability to induce
  transformation and (ii) for associated cellular proteins and corresponding
  enzymatic activities previously described as associating with wild-type {MT}.
  A number of the mutant {MTs} were found to be defective in binding of {PP}2A
  as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. In contrast, a deletion of the highly
  conserved stretch of amino acids 42 to 47 (His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Gly-Gly) in the
  {ST}-{MT}-large T antigen common region did not affect {PP}2A binding to
  {MT}. {MT} mutants defective for {PP}2A binding were also defective in
  transformation, providing further evidence that association with {PP}2A is
  important for the ability of {MT} to transform cells. All mutants which were
  impaired for {PP}2A binding were similarly or more dramatically impaired for
  associated protein and lipid kinase activities, supporting the possibility
  that {PP}2A binding is necessary for the formation and/or stability of an
  {MT}-pp60c-src complex.%

  Recently, many potent inhibitors of protein serine/threonine phosphatases
  ({PPs}) have been found. Some of them have proven to be tumor promoters in
  mouse skin two-step carcinogenesis and rat liver medium-term tests. Among
  these inhibitors, okadaic acid ({OA}) selectively inhibits {PP}2A, and its
  use has therefore been proposed to facilitate analysis of biological roles of
  this phosphatase. {OA} shows bimodal effects on in vitro transformation and,
  in addition to such epigenetic changes, also induces marked genetic changes.
  {OA} treatment for more than 1 week flattened {NIH} 3T3 transformants
  irreversibly, with loss of the transfected genes. It is also known to induce
  diphtheria toxin-resistant mutations in Chinese hamster lung cells and sister
  chromatid exchanges ({SCEs}) in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human
  lymphocytes. To analyze roles of protein phosphatases in gene stability, we
  isolated {OA}-resistant mutants. They were proven to have a mutation in the
  {PP}2A alpha catalytic subunit, in which cysteine 269 had been substituted
  for glycine; and it was demonstrated that this region interacts with {OA}.
  The recombinant mutant protein was 4 approximately 9-fold more resistant to
  {OA} than the wild type. Although the {OA} resistant mutants of {CHO} cells
  expressed high levels of P-glycoprotein, inhibition of {PP}2A itself was
  suggested to lead to {SCE} induction. However, the number of molecular
  species of {PP} which are known to be sensitive to {OA} continues to
  increase, and we have isolated {cDNA} for a novel type of {OA} sensitive
  {PP}. Our studies indicate that the fact that the roles of {PP}2A cannot be
  elucidated using only {OA} is of crucial importance.%

  Summary Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) activity has been
  identified as a prerequisite for the transformation of human cells. However,
  the molecular mechanisms by which {PP}2A activity is inhibited in human
  cancers are currently unclear. In this study, we describe a cellular
  inhibitor of {PP}2A with oncogenic activity. The protein, designated
  Cancerous Inhibitor of {PP}2A ({CIP}2A), interacts directly with the
  oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, inhibits {PP}2A activity toward c-Myc
  serine 62 (S62), and thereby prevents c-Myc proteolytic degradation. In
  addition to its function in c-Myc stabilization, {CIP}2A promotes
  anchorage-independent cell growth and in vivo tumor formation. The oncogenic
  activity of {CIP}2A is demonstrated by transformation of human cells by
  overexpression of {CIP}2A. Importantly, {CIP}2A is overexpressed in two
  common human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC})
  and colon cancer. Thus, our data show that {CIP}2A is a human oncoprotein
  that inhibits {PP}2A and stabilizes c-Myc in human malignancies.%

  The {SV}40 small t antigen ({ST}) interacts with the serine-threonine protein
  phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A). To investigate the role of this interaction in
  transformation, we suppressed the expression of the {PP}2A B56γ subunit in
  human embryonic kidney ({HEK}) epithelial cells expressing {SV}40 large T
  antigen, {hTERT}, and H-{RAS}. Suppression of {PP}2A B56γ expression
  inhibited {PP}2A-specific phosphatase activity similar to that achieved by
  {ST} and conferred the ability to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion
  and to form tumors. Overexpression of {PP}2A B56γ3 in tumorigenic {HEK}
  cells expressing {ST} or human lung cancer cell lines partially reversed the
  tumorigenicity of these cells. These observations identify specific {PP}2A
  complexes involved in human cell transformation.%

  Adipose tissue is central to the regulation of lipid metabolism.
  Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 ({BSCL}2), one of the most
  severe lipodystrophy diseases, is caused by mutation of the Seipin gene.
  Seipin plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid
  homeostasis, but its exact molecular functions are still unknown. Here, we
  show that Seipin physically interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-{ATPase} ({SERCA}) in both Drosophila and man. {SERCA}, an endoplasmic
  reticulum ({ER}) calcium pump, is solely responsible for transporting
  cytosolic calcium into the {ER} lumen. Like {dSeipin}, {dSERCA}
  cell-autonomously promotes lipid storage in Drosophila fat cells. {dSeipin}
  affects {dSERCA} activity and modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis.
  Adipose tissue-specific knockdown of the {ER}-to-cytosol calcium release
  channel ryanodine receptor ({RyR}) partially restores fat storage in
  {dSeipin} mutants. Our results reveal that Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat
  storage by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  {NF}-κB is an important transcription factor in the immune system, and
  aberrant {NF}-κB activity contributes to malignant diseases and
  autoimmunity. In T cells, {NF}-κB is activated upon {TCR} stimulation, and
  signal transduction to {NF}-κB activation is triggered by a cascade of
  phosphorylation events. However, fine-tuning and termination of {TCR}
  signaling are only partially understood. Phosphatases oppose the role of
  kinases by removing phosphate moieties. The catalytic activity of the protein
  phosphatase {PP}2A has been implicated in the regulation of {NF}-κB. {PP}2A
  acts in trimeric complexes in which the catalytic subunit is promiscuous and
  the regulatory subunit confers substrate specificity. To understand and
  eventually target {NF}-κB-specific {PP}2A functions it is essential to
  define the regulatory {PP}2A subunit involved. So far, the regulatory {PP}2A
  subunit that mediates {NF}-κB suppression in T cells remained undefined. By
  performing a {siRNA} screen in Jurkat T cells harboring a {NF}-κB-responsive
  luciferase reporter, we identified the {PP}2A regulatory subunit B56γ as
  negative regulator of {NF}-κB in {TCR} signaling. B56γ was strongly
  up-regulated upon primary human T cell activation, and B56γ silencing
  induced increased {IκB} kinase ({IKK}) and {IκBα} phosphorylation upon
  {TCR} stimulation. B56γ silencing enhanced {NF}-κB activity, resulting in
  increased {NF}-κB target gene expression including the T cell cytokine
  {IL}-2. In addition, T cell proliferation was increased upon B56γ silencing.
  These data help to understand the physiology of {PP}2A function in T cells
  and the pathophysiology of diseases involving {PP}2A and {NF}-κB.%

  Recent data suggest that sterol regulatory-binding protein ({SREBP})-1c plays
  a key role in the transcriptional regulation of different lipogenic genes
  mediating lipid synthesis as a key regulator of fuel metabolism. {SREBP}-1c
  regulates its downstream genes by changing its own {mRNA} level, which led us
  to sequence and analyze the promoter region of the mouse {SREBP}-1c gene. A
  cluster of putative binding sites of several transcription factors composed
  of an {NF}-Y site, an E-box, a sterol-regulatory element 3, and an Sp1 site
  were located at -90 base pairs of the {SREBP}-1c promoter. Luciferase
  reporter gene assays indicated that this {SRE} complex is essential to the
  basal promoter activity and confers responsiveness to activation by nuclear
  {SREBPs}. Deletion and mutation analyses suggest that the {NF}-Y site and
  {SRE}3 in the {SRE} complex are responsible for {SREBP} activation, although
  the other sites were also involved in the basal activity. Gel mobility shift
  assays demonstrate that {SREBP}-1 binds to the {SRE}3. Taken together, these
  findings implicate a positive loop production of {SREBP}-1c through the {SRE}
  complex, possibly leading to the overshoot in induction of {SREBP}-1c and its
  downstream genes seen in the livers of refed mice. Furthermore, reporter
  assays using larger upstream fragments indicated another region that was
  inducible by addition of sterols. The presence of the {SRE} complex and a
  sterol-inducible region in the same promoter suggests a novel regulatory link
  between cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.%

  The main aim of this study was to set up a new animal model to study insulin
  resistance. Wistar rats (6 or 7 per group) received the following for 4 wk in
  experiment 1: 1) vehicle, 2) 2 microg/day subcutaneous dexamethasone, 3)
  metformin (400 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) os), and 4) dexamethasone plus
  metformin. In experiment 2 the rats received the following: 1) vehicle, 2)
  dexamethasone, 3) dexamethasone plus arginine (2\%; as substrate of the
  nitric oxide synthase for nitric oxide production) in tap water, and 4)
  dexamethasone plus isosorbide dinitrate (70 mg/kg; as direct nitric oxide
  donor) in tap water. Insulin sensitivity was significantly reduced by
  dexamethasone already at week 1, before the increase in blood pressure (day
  15) and without significant changes in body weight compared with vehicle.
  Dexamethasone-treated rats had significantly higher triglycerides,
  hematocrit, and insulin, whereas serum total nitrates/ nitrites were lower
  compared with vehicle. The concomitant treatment with metformin minimized all
  the described effects of dexamethasone. In experiment 2, only isosorbide
  dinitrate was able to prevent the observed dexamethasone-induced metabolic,
  hemodynamic, and insulin sensitivity changes. Chronic low-dose subcutaneous
  dexamethasone (2 microg/day) is a useful model to study the relationships
  between insulin resistance and blood pressure in the rat, and dexamethasone
  might decrease insulin sensitivity and increase blood pressure through an
  endothelium-mediated mechanism.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Diabetes is a disease characterized by a relative or absolute lack of
  insulin, leading to hyperglycaemia. There are two main types of diabetes:
  type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is due to an autoimmune
  destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, and type 2
  diabetes is caused by insulin resistance coupled by a failure of the beta
  cell to compensate. Animal models for type 1 diabetes range from animals with
  spontaneously developing autoimmune diabetes to chemical ablation of the
  pancreatic beta cells. Type 2 diabetes is modelled in both obese and
  non-obese animal models with varying degrees of insulin resistance and beta
  cell failure. This review outlines some of the models currently used in
  diabetes research. In addition, the use of transgenic and knock-out mouse
  models is discussed. Ideally, more than one animal model should be used to
  represent the diversity seen in human diabetic patients.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Up to 5\% of young adults diagnosed with diabetes have a monogenic aetiology,
  the most common of which is maturity-onset diabetes of the young ({MODY}). A
  definitive molecular diagnosis is important, as this affects treatment,
  prognosis and family screening. Currently, however, rates of diagnosis are
  low due to a combination of lack of awareness of the benefits of making the
  diagnosis and the challenges of differentiating patients with {MODY} from
  those with common forms of diabetes. This article aims to introduce general
  physicians to the characteristics of monogenic diabetes and the clinical
  features that can be used to diagnose patients. Recently, genomewide
  association studies have resulted in the identification of C-reactive protein
  and glycan profile as specific biomarkers for the most common {MODY} subtype
  due to {HNF}1A mutations, and the potential translation of these findings are
  discussed.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Evaluation of glucose uptake ability in cells plays a fundamental role in
  diabetes mellitus research. In this study, we describe a sensitive and
  non-radioactive assay for direct and rapid measuring glucose uptake in
  single, living cells. The assay is based on direct incubation of mammalian
  cells with a fluorescent d-glucose analog
  2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-{NBDG})
  followed by flow cytometric detection of fluorescence produced by the cells.
  A series of experiments were conducted to define optimal conditions for this
  assay. By this technique, it was found that insulin lost its physiological
  effects on cells in vitro meanwhile some other anti-diabetic drugs
  facilitated the cell glucose uptake rates with mechanisms which likely to be
  different from those of insulin or those that were generally accepted of each
  drug. Our findings show that this technology has potential for applications
  in both medicine and research.%

  The clinical value of assessing tumor glucose metabolism via F-18
  Fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG}) {PET} imaging in oncology is well established;
  however, the poor spatial resolution of {PET} is a significant limitation
  especially for early stage lesions. An alternative technology is optical
  molecular imaging, which allows for subcellular spatial resolution and can be
  effectively used with topical contrast agents for imaging epithelial derived
  cancers. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical
  molecular imaging of glucose metabolism to aid in early detection of oral
  neoplasia. Fluorescently labeled deoxyglucose (2-{NBDG}
  (2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose)) was
  applied topically to tissue phantoms, fresh oral biopsies (n=32) and resected
  tumors specimens (n=2). High-resolution imaging results show that 2-{NBDG}
  can be rapidly delivered to oral epithelium using topical application. In
  normal epithelium, the uptake of 2-{NBDG} is limited to basal epithelial
  cells. In contrast high grade dysplasia and cancers show uptake of 2-{NBDG}
  in neoplastic cells throughout the lesion. Following 2-{NBDG} labeling, the
  mean fluorescence intensity of neoplastic tissue averages 3.7 times higher
  than that of matched non-neoplastic oral biopsies in samples from 20
  patients. Widefield fluorescence images of 8-paired oral specimens were
  obtained pre- and post-labeling with 2-{NBDG}. Prior to labeling, neoplastic
  samples showed significantly lower autofluorescence than non-neoplastic
  samples. The fluorescence of neoplastic samples increased dramatically after
  labeling; the differential increase in fluorescence was on average 30 times
  higher in neoplastic samples than in normal samples. Topical application of
  2-{NBDG} can therefore provide image contrast in both widefield and
  high-resolution fluorescence imaging modalities, highlighting its potential
  in early detection of oral neoplasia.%

  Summary {SIRT}6 is a member of a highly conserved family of {NAD}+-dependent
  deacetylases with various roles in metabolism, stress resistance, and life
  span. {SIRT}6-deficient mice develop normally but succumb to a lethal
  hypoglycemia early in life; however, the mechanism underlying this
  hypoglycemia remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that {SIRT}6 functions as
  a histone H3K9 deacetylase to control the expression of multiple glycolytic
  genes. Specifically, {SIRT}6 appears to function as a corepressor of the
  transcription factor Hif1α, a critical regulator of nutrient stress
  responses. Consistent with this notion, {SIRT}6-deficient cells exhibit
  increased Hif1α activity and show increased glucose uptake with upregulation
  of glycolysis and diminished mitochondrial respiration. Our studies uncover a
  role for the chromatin factor {SIRT}6 as a master regulator of glucose
  homeostasis and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches
  against metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity.%

  Summary Short hairpin {RNAs} ({shRNAs}) provide powerful experimental tools
  by enabling stable and regulated gene silencing through programming of
  endogenous {microRNA} pathways. Since requirements for efficient {shRNA}
  biogenesis and target suppression are largely unknown, many predicted
  {shRNAs} fail to efficiently suppress their target. To overcome this barrier,
  we developed a “Sensor assay” that enables the biological identification
  of effective {shRNAs} at large scale. By constructing and evaluating 20,000
  {RNAi} reporters covering every possible target site in nine mammalian
  transcripts, we show that our assay reliably identifies potent {shRNAs} that
  are surprisingly rare and predominantly missed by existing algorithms. Our
  unbiased analyses reveal that potent {shRNAs} share various predicted and
  previously unknown features associated with specific {microRNA} processing
  steps, and suggest a model for competitive strand selection. Together, our
  study establishes a powerful tool for large-scale identification of highly
  potent {shRNAs} and provides insights into sequence requirements of effective
  {RNAi}.%

  Summary The aberrant accumulation of lipids in the liver (“fatty liver”)
  is tightly associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome,
  including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. Here
  we show that the impaired hepatic expression of transcriptional cofactor
  transducin beta-like ({TBL}) 1 represents a common feature of mono- and
  multigenic fatty liver mouse models. Indeed, the liver-specific ablation of
  {TBL}1 gene expression in healthy mice promoted hypertriglyceridemia and
  hepatic steatosis under both normal and high-fat dietary conditions. {TBL}1
  deficiency resulted in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation due to impaired
  functional cooperation with its heterodimerization partner {TBL}-related
  ({TBLR}) 1 and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor ({PPAR}) α. As {TBL}1 expression levels were found to also
  inversely correlate with liver fat content in human patients, the lack of
  hepatic {TBL}1/{TBLR}1 cofactor activity may represent a molecular rationale
  for hepatic steatosis in subjects with obesity and the metabolic syndrome.%

  To examine the role of histamine H1 and H2 receptors in the regulation of
  lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced liver injury, a combination of
  D-galactosamine and {LPS} ({GalN}/{LPS}) was administered to histamine H1
  receptor knockout (H1-R {KO}) and H2 receptor knockout (H2-R {KO}) mice. The
  numbers of necrotic and apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver, as well as the
  levels of serum aspartate transaminase ({AST}) and alanine transaminase
  ({ALT}), were increased significantly by {GalN}/{LPS} treatment compared to
  the appropriate controls. Pretreatment with histamine ameliorated the
  {GalN}/{LPS}-induced necrotic and apoptotic changes in the hepatocytes and
  inhibited the elevation of serum {AST} and {ALT} levels. Histamine attenuated
  the {GalN}/{LPS}-induced increases in the levels of {TNF}-alpha, but
  augmented those of {IL}-10 both in the liver and serum. Histamine inhibited
  the {GalN}/{LPS}-induced caspase-3 activity in the liver. Furthermore, these
  effects of histamine were completely or partially attenuated in H2-R {KO}
  mice, but not in H1-R {KO} mice. Peritoneal macrophages from H2-R {KO} mice
  exhibited blunted changes in the effects of histamine on {LPS}-induced
  {TNF}-alpha and {IL}-10 production in vitro compared to the wild-type ({WT})
  controls. In summary, the present findings suggest that the histamine
  H2-R-{TNF}-alpha and -{IL}-10 pathways play protective roles in
  endotoxin-induced hepatic injury.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Homeostatic model assessment ({HOMA}) is a method for assessing β-cell
  function and insulin resistance ({IR}) from basal (fasting) glucose and
  insulin or C-peptide concentrations. It has been reported in
  {\textgreater}500 publications, 20 times more frequently for the estimation
  of {IR} than β-cell function. This article summarizes the physiological
  basis of {HOMA}, a structural model of steady-state insulin and glucose
  domains, constructed from physiological dose responses of glucose uptake and
  insulin production. Hepatic and peripheral glucose efflux and uptake were
  modeled to be dependent on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.
  Decreases in β-cell function were modeled by changing the β-cell response
  to plasma glucose concentrations. The original {HOMA} model was described in
  1985 with a formula for approximate estimation. The computer model is
  available but has not been as widely used as the approximation formulae.
  {HOMA} has been validated against a variety of physiological methods. We
  review the use and reporting of {HOMA} in the literature and give guidance on
  its appropriate use (e.g., cohort and epidemiological studies) and
  inappropriate use (e.g., measuring β-cell function in isolation). The {HOMA}
  model compares favorably with other models and has the advantage of requiring
  only a single plasma sample assayed for insulin and glucose. In conclusion,
  the {HOMA} model has become a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool
  and, when used appropriately, it can yield valuable data. However, as with
  all models, the primary input data need to be robust, and the data need to be
  interpreted carefully.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  In mammals, there are different metabolic pathways in cells that break down
  fuel molecules to transfer their energy into high energy compounds such as
  adenosine-5'-triphosphate ({ATP}), guanosine-5'-triphosphate ({GTP}), reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ({NADH}2), reduced flavin adenine
  dinucleotide ({FADH}2) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate ({NADPH}2). This process is called cellular respiration. In
  carbohydrate metabolism, the breakdown starts from digestion of food in the
  gastrointestinal tract and is followed by absorption of carbohydrate
  components by the enterocytes in the form of monosaccharides. Monosaccharides
  are transferred to cells for aerobic and anaerobic respiration via
  glycolysis, citric acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway to be used in the
  starvation state. In the normal state, the skeletal muscle and liver cells
  store monosaccharides in the form of glycogen. In the obesity state, the
  extra glucose is converted to triglycerides via lipogenesis and is stored in
  the lipid droplets of adipocytes. In the lipotoxicity state, the lipid
  droplets of other tissues such as the liver, skeletal muscle and pancreatic
  beta cells also accumulate triacylglycerol. This event is the axis of the
  pathogenesis of metabolic dysregulation in insulin resistance, metabolic
  syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In this paper a summary of the metabolism of
  carbohydrates is presented in a way that researchers can follow the
  biochemical processes easily.%

  Most of the triacylglycerol ({TAG}) utilized for the assembly of
  very-low-density lipoprotein ({VLDL}) in the secretory apparatus of the
  hepatocyte is mobilized by lipolysis of the cytosolic {TAG} pool, followed by
  re-esterification. The lipases involved include arylacetamide deacetylase
  and/or triacylglycerol hydrolase. Some of the re-esterified products of
  lipolysis gain access to an apolipoprotein-B-rich {VLDL} precursor to form
  mature {VLDL}. Some, however, are returned to the cytosolic pool in a process
  that is stimulated by insulin and inhibited by microsomal triacylglycerol
  transfer protein ({MTP}). Phospholipids also contribute to {VLDL} {TAG} in a
  process which involves {ADP}-ribosylation factor-1 ({ARF}-1)-mediated
  activation of phospholipase D. The temporary storage of {TAG} in the liver,
  followed by its mobilization and secretion as {VLDL}, form part of a process
  by which the liver protects vulnerable body tissues from excess lipotoxic
  non-esterified ('free') fatty acids in the plasma.%

  Background: Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased risk of
  cardiovascular disease. Until recently, the importance of hepatic de novo
  lipogenesis ({DNL}) in contributing to hypertriglyceridemia was difficult to
  assess because of methodologic limitations. Objective: We evaluated the
  extent of the contribution by {DNL} to different conditions associated with
  hypertriglyceridemia. Design: After 5 d of an isoenergetic high-fat,
  low-carbohydrate diet, fasting {DNL} was measured in normoinsulinemic (≤ 85
  pmol/L) lean (n = 9) and obese (n = 6) and hyperinsulinemic (≥ 115 pmol/L)
  obese (n = 8) subjects. Fasting {DNL} was measured after a low-fat,
  high-carbohydrate diet in normoinsulinemic lean (n = 5) and hyperinsulinemic
  obese (n = 5) subjects. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis was used to
  measure the fraction of newly synthesized fatty acids in
  {VLDL}-triacylglycerol. Results: With the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet,
  hyperinsulinemic obese subjects had a 3.7–5.3-fold higher fractional {DNL}
  (8.5 ± 0.7\%) than did normoinsulinemic lean (1.6 ± 0.5\%) or obese (2.3 ±
  0.3\%) subjects. With the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, normoinsulinemic
  lean and hyperinsulinemic obese subjects had similarly high fractional {DNL}
  (13 ± 5.1\% and 12.8 ± 1.4\%, respectively). Compared with baseline,
  consumption of the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet did not affect
  triacylglycerol concentrations. However, after the low-fat, high-carbohydrate
  diet, triacylglycerols increased significantly and {DNL} was 5–6-fold
  higher than in normoinsulinemic subjects consuming a high-fat diet. The
  increase in triacylglycerol after the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet was
  correlated with fractional {DNL} (P {\textless} 0.01), indicating that
  subjects with high {DNL} had the greatest increase in triacylglycerols.
  Conclusions: These results support the concept that both hyperinsulinemia and
  a low-fat diet increase {DNL}, and that {DNL} contributes to
  hypertriglyceridemia.%

  Hepatic glycogen is replenished during the absorptive period postprandially.
  This repletion is prompted partly by an increased hepatic uptake of glucose
  by the liver, partly by metabolite and hormonal signals in the portal vein,
  and partly by an increased gluconeogenic flux to glycogen (glyconeogenesis).
  There is some evidence that the direct formation of glycogen from glucose and
  that formed by gluconeogenic pathways is linked. This includes: (i) the
  inhibition of all glycogen synthesis, in vivo, when gluconeogenic flux is
  blocked by inhibitors; (ii) a dual relationship between glucose
  concentrations, lactate uptake by the liver and glycogen synthesis (by both
  pathways) which indicates that glucose sets the maximal rates of glycogen
  synthesis while lactate uptake determines the actual flux rate to glycogen;
  (iii) the decrease of both gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis by the
  biguanide, metformin; and (iv) correlations between increased gluconeogenesis
  and liver glycogen in obese patients and animal models. The degree to which
  the liver extracts portal glucose is not entirely agreed upon although a
  preponderance of evidence points to about a 5\% extraction rate, following
  meals, which is dependent on a stimulation of glucokinase. This enzyme may be
  linked to the expression of other enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway.
  Perivenous cells in the liver may induce additional gluconeogenesis in the
  periportal cells by increasing glycolytically produced lactate. A number of
  potential mechanisms therefore exist which could link glycogen synthesis from
  glucose and gluconeogenic substrate.%

  {PTP}1B is a protein tyrosine-phosphatase located on the cytosolic side of
  the endoplasmic reticulum that plays an important role in the regulation of
  the insulin receptor ({IR}). Replacement of the conserved Asp-181 by alanine
  is known to convert {PTP}1B into a substrate-trapping protein that binds to
  but cannot dephosphorylate its substrates. In this work, we have studied the
  effect of an additional mutation (Y46F) on the substrate-trapping efficiency
  of {PTP}1B-D181A. We observed that this mutation converts {PTP}1B-D181A into
  a highly efficient substrate-trapping mutant, resulting in much higher
  recovery of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coimmunoprecipitated with
  {PTP}1B. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ({BRET}) experiments were
  also performed to compare the dynamics of interaction of the {IR} with these
  mutants. Basal {BRET}, which mainly reflects the interaction of {PTP}1B with
  the {IR} precursor during its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, was
  markedly increased with the {PTP}1B-D181A-Y46F mutant. In contrast,
  insulin-induced {BRET} was markedly reduced with {PTP}1B-D181A-Y46F. I125
  insulin binding experiments indicated that {PTP}1B-D181-Y46F reduced the
  expression of {IR} at the plasma membrane. Reduced expression at the cell
  surface was associated with higher amounts of the uncleaved {IR} precursor in
  the cell. Moreover, we observed that substantial amounts of the uncleaved
  {IR} precursor reached the Tris-phosphorylated, fully activated form in an
  insulin independent fashion. These results support the notion that {PTP}1B
  plays a crucial role in the control of the activity of the {IR} precursor
  during its biosynthesis. In addition, this new substrate-trapping mutant may
  be a valuable tool for the identification of new {PTP}1B substrates.%

  Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade
  involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and
  dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and
  phosphatases, respectively. {PTPN}22 (Lyp), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine
  phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin,
  notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor.
  We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide
  identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates
  of {PTPN}22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from
  pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using {PTPN}22-D195A/C227S, an optimized
  substrate trap mutant of {PTPN}22. These included three novel {PTPN}22
  substrates (Vav, {CD}3ϵ, and valosin containing protein) and two known
  substrates of {PEP}, the mouse homolog of {PTPN}22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell
  antigen receptor ({TCR}) ζ was also identified as a potential substrate in
  Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified
  recombinant proteins demonstrated that {PTPN}22-D195A/C227S interacted
  directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and {TCRζ}, confirming the initial
  substrate trap results. Native {PTPN}22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at
  their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not
  at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native {PTPN}22
  also dephosphorylated {TCRζ} in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap
  variant co-immunoprecipitated with {TCRζ} when both were coexpressed in 293T
  cells, establishing {TCRζ} as a direct substrate of {PTPN}22.%

  Mitogen-activated protein ({MAP}) kinase phosphatase-1 ({MKP}-1) is a
  nuclear, dual-specificity phosphatase that has been shown to dephosphorylate
  {MAP} kinases. We used a “substrate-trap” technique involving a mutation
  in {MKP}-1 of the catalytically critical cysteine to a serine residue
  (“{CS}” mutant) to capture novel {MKP}-1 substrates. We transfected the
  {MKP}-1 ({CS}) mutant and control (wild-type, {WT}) constructs into phorbol
  12-myristate 13-acetate ({PMA})-activated {COS}-1 cells. {MKP}-1-substrate
  complexes were immunoprecipitated, which yielded four bands of 17, 15, 14,
  and 10 {kDa} with the {CS} {MKP}-1 mutant but not the {WT} {MKP}-1. The bands
  were identified by mass spectrometry as histones H3, H2B, H2A, and H4,
  respectively. Histone H3 was phosphorylated, and purified {MKP}-1
  dephosphorylated histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) in vitro; whereas, histone H3
  (phospho-Thr-3) was unaffected. We have previously shown that thrombin and
  vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) upregulated {MKP}-1 in human
  endothelial cells ({EC}). We now show that both thrombin and {VEGF} caused
  dephosphorylation of histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10) and histone H3
  (phospho-Thr-3) in {EC} with kinetics consistent with {MKP}-1 induction.
  Furthermore, {MKP}-1-specific small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) prevented
  {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation but had no
  effect on H3 (phospho-Thr-3 or Thr-11) dephosphorylation. In summary, histone
  H3 is a novel substrate of {MKP}-1, and {VEGF}- and thrombin-induced H3
  (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation requires {MKP}-1. We propose that
  {MKP}-1-mediated H3 (phospho-Ser-10) dephosphorylation is a key regulatory
  step in {EC} activation by {VEGF} and thrombin.%

  We have developed a new technique for proximity-dependent labeling of
  proteins in eukaryotic cells. Named {BioID} for proximity-dependent biotin
  identification, this approach is based on fusion of a promiscuous Escherichia
  coli biotin protein ligase to a targeting protein. {BioID} features
  proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the
  fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and
  identified by mass spectrometry. We apply {BioID} to lamin-A ({LaA}), a
  well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the
  nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope
  ({NE}). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are
  proximate to {LaA} in vivo. The most abundant of these include known
  interactors of {LaA} that are localized to the {NE}, as well as a new
  {NE}-associated protein named {SLAP}75. Our results suggest {BioID} is a
  useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and
  neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment.%

  Biotin protein ligases ({BPLs}) are enzymes of extraordinary specificity.
  {BirA}, the {BPL} of Escherichia coli biotinylates only a single cellular

  A method for general protein biotinylation by enzymatic means has been
  developed. A mutant form (R118G) of the biotin protein ligase ({BirA}) of
  Escherichia coli is used and biotinylation is thought to proceed by chemical
  acylation of protein lysine side chains by biotinoyl-5'-{AMP} released from
  the mutant protein. Bovine serum albumin, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase,
  immunoglobulin chains and {RNAse} A as well as a large number of E. coli
  proteins have been biotinylated. The biotinylation reaction is proximity
  dependent in that the extent of biotinylation is much greater when the ligase
  is coupled to the acceptor protein than when the acceptor is free in
  solution. This is presumably due to rapid hydrolysis of the acylation agent,
  biotinoyl-5'-{AMP}. Therefore, when the mutant ligase is attached to one
  partner involved in a protein-protein interaction, it can be used to
  specifically tag the other partner with biotin, thereby permitting facile
  detection and recovery of the proteins by existing avidin/streptavidin
  technology.%

  Interaction between the heterodimeric form of protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A)
  and polyomavirus middle T antigen ({MT}) is required for the subsequent
  assembly of a transformation-competent {MT} complex. To investigate the role
  of {PP}2A catalytic activity in {MT} complex formation, we undertook a
  mutational analysis of the {PP}2A 36-{kDa} catalytic C subunit. Several
  residues likely to be involved in the dephosphorylation mechanism were
  identified and mutated. The resultant catalytically inactive C subunit
  mutants were then analyzed for their ability to associate with a cellular (B
  subunit) or a viral ({MT}) B-type subunit. Strikingly, while all of the
  inactive mutants were severely impaired in their interaction with B subunit,
  most of these mutants formed complexes with polyomavirus {MT}. These findings
  indicate a potential role for these catalytically important residues in
  complex formation with cellular B subunit, but not in complex formation with
  {MT}. Transformation-competent {MT} is known to associate with, and modulate
  the activity of, several cellular proteins, including pp60c-src family
  kinases. To determine whether association of {MT} with an active {PP}2A A-C
  heterodimer is necessary for subsequent association with pp60c-src,
  catalytically inactive C subunits were examined for their ability to form
  complexes containing pp60c-src in {MT}-expressing cells. Two catalytically
  inactive C subunit mutants that efficiently formed complexes with {MT} also
  formed complexes that included an active pp60c-src kinase, demonstrating that
  {PP}2A activity is not essential in cis in {MT} complexes for subsequent
  pp60c-src association.%

  {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates Ser-77 and -1200;
  5'-{AMP}-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates Ser-79, -1200, and -1215. In
  this report, the construction and expression of {ACC} {cDNA} containing the
  entire coding region (7.2 kilobase pairs) is described. In order to identify
  the critical phosphorylation site(s) for each protein kinase, we introduced
  site-specific mutations at Ser-77, -79, -1200, and -1215 of {ACC} {cDNA} and
  a series of mutated {ACCs} containing various combinations of these four
  mutated sites was expressed. By examination of the various mutant {ACCs}, we
  provided evidence that the effect of {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase is
  entirely mediated by the phosphorylation of Ser-1200 and that Ser-79 is
  important for 5'-{AMP}-dependent protein kinase action in vitro.%

  In vivo, hormone-sensitive lipase ({HSL}) is known to be phosphorylated on
  two sites termed the regulatory and basal sites. However, the intracellular
  role of the basal site or the identity of the protein kinase phosphorylating
  this site has not been established. We show that
  5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside ({AICAR}) markedly activates
  cellular {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) in a time- and
  dose-dependent manner. As expected for an agent that activates {AMPK}
  intracellularly, {AICAR} had no effect on the basal activity of {HSL}.
  However, preincubation of adipocytes with {AICAR} led to a reduced response
  of these cells to the lipolytic agent isoprenaline. {AICAR} was also shown to
  profoundly inhibit lipogenesis through increased phosphorylation of
  acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase ({ACC}). Thus it appears that in addition to
  regulating lipogenesis, {AMPK} also plays an important antilipolytic role by
  regulating {HSL} in rat adipocytes.%

  The liver plays a central role in glucose homeostasis in the whole-body by
  responding to environmental factors including nutrients, hormones, and
  oxygen. In conditions of metabolic overload such as diabetes mellitus and
  obesity, coordinated regulation between oxygen supply and consumption has
  been reported to be disrupted and subsequently cause tissue hypoxia, although
  pathological significance of the disease-related hypoxia remains elusive. To
  investigate the role of tissue hypoxia in the liver on systemic glucose
  homeostasis, mice lacking {HIF}-1α gene, a critical component of a master
  regulator of hypoxic response, in hepatocytes were exposed to high
  fat/sucrose diet ({HFSD}). Exposure to {HFSD} for 5 weeks elicited liver
  hypoxia with a transient increase in {HIF}-1α protein expression in the
  liver of control mice. Glucose disposal was marginally impaired in control
  mice when challenged oral glucose tolerance test, but such impairment was
  enhanced in the mutant mice. This alteration was accompanied by a complete
  inhibition of glucokinase induction with a significant reduction of hepatic
  glucose uptake. Mice fed {HFSD} for 20 weeks exhibited fasting hyperglycemia
  and glucose intolerance, whereas these metabolic phenotypes deteriorated
  considerably with severe insulin resistance in skeletal muscles and adipose
  tissues in the mutant mice. These findings suggest that {HIF}-1 in
  hepatocytes plays protective roles against the progression of diabetes
  mellitus.%

  Chronic alcohol causes hepatic steatosis and liver hypoxia. Hypoxia-regulated
  hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, ({HIF}-1α) may regulate liporegulatory genes,
  but the relationship of {HIF}-1 to steatosis remains unknown. We investigated
  {HIF}-1α in alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Alcohol
  administration resulted in steatosis, increased liver triglyceride levels,
  and increased serum alanine aminotransferase ({ALT}) levels, suggesting liver
  injury in wild-type ({WT}) mice. There was increased hepatic {HIF}-1α
  messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}), protein, and {DNA}-binding activity in alcohol-fed
  mice compared with controls. Mice engineered with hepatocyte-specific {HIF}-1
  activation ({HIF}1dPA) had increased {HIF}-1α {mRNA}, protein, and
  {DNA}-binding activity, and alcohol feeding in {HIF}1dPA mice increased
  hepatomegaly and hepatic triglyceride compared with {WT} mice. In contrast,
  hepatocyte-specific deletion of {HIF}-1α [{HIF}-1α(Hep−/−)], protected
  mice from alcohol- and lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced liver damage, serum
  {ALT} elevation, hepatomegaly, and lipid accumulation. {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−),
  {WT}, and {HIF}1dPA mice had equally suppressed levels of peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor α {mRNA} after chronic ethanol, whereas the
  {HIF} target, adipocyte differentiation-related protein, was up-regulated in
  {WT} mice but not {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−) ethanol-fed/{LPS}-challenged mice.
  The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ({MCP}-1) was cooperatively
  induced by alcohol feeding and {LPS} in {WT} but not {HIF}-1α(Hep−/−)
  mice. Using Huh7 hepatoma cells in vitro, we found that {MCP}-1 treatment
  induced lipid accumulation and increased {HIF}-1α protein expression as well
  as {DNA}-binding activity. Small interfering {RNA} inhibition of {HIF}-1α
  prevented {MCP}-1–induced lipid accumulation, suggesting a mechanistic role
  for {HIF}-1α in hepatocyte lipid accumulation. Conclusion: Alcohol feeding
  results in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes involving {HIF}-1α activation.
  The alcohol-induced chemokine {MCP}-1 triggers lipid accumulation in
  hepatocytes via {HIF}-1α activation, suggesting a mechanistic link between
  inflammation and hepatic steatosis in alcoholic liver disease. ({HEPATOLOGY}

  \field{abstract}{%
  We have previously shown that exposure of C57BL/6J mice to intermittent
  hypoxia ({IH}) leads to 1) hypertriglyceridemia due to upregulation of
  pathways of lipid biosynthesis, including sterol regulatory element binding
  protein ({SREBP})-1 and stearoyl {CoA} desaturase ({SCD})-1; and 2)
  hypercholesterolemia due to impaired cholesterol uptake. The goal of the
  present study was to examine whether hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF})-1 is
  implicated in changes in lipid metabolism induced by {IH}. Lean {HIF}-1α
  (Hif1a)+/− mice, which are heterozygous for a null allele at the locus
  encoding the {HIF}-1α subunit, and their wild-type ({WT}) Hif1a+/+
  littermates were exposed to {IH} or control conditions for 5 days. {IH}
  increased fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, and high-density
  lipoprotein-cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides ({TG}), and leptin in
  mice of both genotypes, whereas serum insulin and interleukin-6 were elevated
  only in {WT} mice. The impact of {IH} on serum {TG} levels in {WT} mice was
  significantly greater than that in Hif1a+/− mice (95 ± 9 vs. 66 ± 6
  mg/dl, P {\textless} 0.05), whereas cholesterol and glucose levels were
  affected independently of genotype. Under hypoxic conditions, {mRNA} and
  protein levels of {SREBP} cleavage-activating protein ({SCAP}) and {SCD}-1
  and protein levels of nuclear isoform of {SREBP}-1 in the liver were induced
  to significantly higher levels in {WT} mice than in Hif1a+/− mice. We
  conclude that 1) the effect of {IH} on serum {TG} levels is mediated through
  {HIF}-1, 2) {HIF}-1 may impact on posttranscriptional regulation of
  {SREBP}-1, and 3) the effect of {IH} on serum cholesterol levels was not
  altered by partial {HIF}-1α deficiency.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Obstructive sleep apnea, a syndrome leading to recurrent intermittent hypoxia
  ({IH}), has been associated previously with hypercholesterolemia, independent
  of underlying obesity. We examined the effects of experimentally induced {IH}
  on serum lipid levels and pathways of lipid metabolism in the absence and
  presence of obesity. Lean C57BL/6J mice and leptin-deficient obese
  C57BL/6J-Lepob mice were exposed to {IH} for five days to determine changes
  in serum lipid profile, liver lipid content, and expression of key hepatic
  genes of lipid metabolism. In lean mice, exposure to {IH} increased fasting
  serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein ({HDL})
  cholesterol, phospholipids ({PLs}), and triglycerides ({TGs}), as well as
  liver {TG} content. These changes were not observed in obese mice, which had
  hyperlipidemia and fatty liver at baseline. In lean mice, {IH} increased
  sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 ({SREBP}-1) levels in the liver,
  increased {mRNA} and protein levels of stearoyl–coenzyme A desaturase 1
  ({SCD}-1), an important gene of {TG} and {PL} biosynthesis controlled by
  {SREBP}-1, and increased monounsaturated fatty acid content in serum, which
  indicated augmented {SCD}-1 activity. In addition, in lean mice, {IH}
  decreased protein levels of scavenger receptor B1, regulating uptake of
  cholesterol esters and {HDL} by the liver. We conclude that exposure to {IH}
  for five days increases serum cholesterol and {PL} levels, upregulates
  pathways of {TG} and {PL} biosynthesis, and inhibits pathways of cholesterol
  uptake in the liver in the lean state but does not exacerbate the
  pre-existing hyperlipidemia and metabolic disturbances in leptin-deficient
  obesity.%

  Summary We have previously shown that expression of the transcription factor
  {ARNT}/{HIF}1β is reduced in islets of humans with type 2 diabetes. We have
  now found that {ARNT} is also reduced in livers of diabetics. To study the
  functional effect of its reduction, we created mice with liver-specific
  ablation (L-{ARNT} {KO}) using {ARNT} {loxP} mice and adenoviral-mediated
  delivery of Cre. L-{ARNT} {KO} mice had normal blood glucose but increased
  fed insulin levels. These mice also exhibited features of type 2 diabetes
  with increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased lipogenic gene expression,
  and low serum β-hydroxybutyrate. These effects appear to be secondary to
  increased expression of {CCAAT}/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/{EBPα}),
  farnesoid X receptor ({FXR}), and sterol response element-binding protein 1c
  ({SREBP}-1c) and a reduction in phosphorylation of {AMPK} without changes in
  the expression of enzymes in ketogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, or {FGF}21.
  These results demonstrate that a deficiency of {ARNT} action in the liver,
  coupled with that in β cells, could contribute to the metabolic phenotype of
  human type 2 diabetes.%

  We describe an improved Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} (Zn2+–Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE})
  using a dizinc({II}) complex of Phos-tag acrylamide in conjunction with a
  Bis-tris-buffered neutral-{pH} gel system to detect shifts in the mobility of

  polyacrylamide-bound Mn2+–Phos-tag and a conventional Laemmli's buffer
  system under alkaline {pH} conditions has limitations for separating certain
  phosphoproteins. The major improvements were demonstrated by visualizing
  novel up-shifted bands of commercially available pepsin, recombinant Tau
  treated in vitro with tyrosine kinases, and endogeneous β-catenin in
  whole-cell lysates. Additionally, the Zn2+–Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} gels
  showed better long-term stability than the Mn2+–Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} gels.
  We can therefore provide a simple, convenient, and more reliable homemade gel
  system for phosphate-affinity {SDS}-{PAGE}.%

  To engage in proliferation, cells need to increase their biomass and
  replicate their genome. This process presents a substantial bioenergetic
  challenge: proliferating cells must increase {ATP} production and acquire or
  synthesize raw materials, including lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. To do
  so, proliferating cells actively reprogramme their intracellular metabolism
  from catabolic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ({OXPHOS}) to
  glycolysis and other anabolic pathways. This metabolic reprogramming, which
  directs nutrient uptake and metabolism during cell activation and
  proliferation, is under the control of specific signal transduction pathways.
  The underlying molecular mechanisms of cell metabolism reprogramming and
  their relevance to physiology and disease are currently under intense study.
  Several reports have uncovered the mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming that
  drive high rates of cell proliferation in cancer. Some recent studies have
  elucidated the physiological role of metabolic reprogramming during T-cell
  activation, differentiation and trafficking, which are potentially relevant
  to inflammatory disorders. This review describes the impact of metabolic
  reprogramming on the pathogenesis of cancer and the physiology of
  T-cell-mediated immune responses, with an emphasis on the phosphatidyl
  inositol 3-kinase–serine/threonine kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin
  pathway and the recently discovered metabolic processes regulated by nuclear
  factor-κB. These discoveries will hopefully translate into a better
  understanding of the role of metabolic reprogramming as a key regulator of
  T-cell-mediated immune responses and offer novel, immune-based therapeutic
  approaches.%

  Phosphorylation is a major post-translational modification widely used in the
  regulation of many cellular processes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a
  proline-directed serine/threonine kinase activated by activation subunit p35.
  Cdk5-p35 regulates various neuronal activities such as neuronal migration,
  spine formation, synaptic activity, and cell death. The kinase activity of
  Cdk5 is regulated by proteolysis of p35: proteasomal degradation causes
  down-regulation of Cdk5, whereas cleavage of p35 by calpain causes
  overactivation of Cdk5. Phosphorylation of p35 determines the proteolytic
  pathway. We have previously identified Ser8 and Thr138 as major
  phosphorylation sites using metabolic labeling of cultured cells followed by
  two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphospecific antibodies.
  However, these approaches cannot determine the extent of p35 phosphorylation
  in vivo. Here we report the use of Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} to reveal the
  phosphorylation states of p35 in neuronal culture and brain. Using Phos-tag
  acrylamide, the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated p35 was delayed
  because it is trapped at Phos-tag sites. We found a novel phosphorylation
  site at Ser91, which was phosphorylated by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase {II} in vitro. We constructed phosphorylation-dependent banding
  profiles of p35 and Ala substitution mutants at phosphorylation sites
  co-expressed with Cdk5 in {COS}-7 cells. Using the standard banding profiles,
  we assigned respective bands of endogenous p35 with combinations of
  phosphorylation states and quantified Ser8, Ser91, and Thr138
  phosphorylation. The highest level of p35 phosphorylation was observed in
  embryonic brain; Ser8 was phosphorylated in all p35 molecules, whereas Ser91
  was phosphorylated in 60\% and Thr138 was phosphorylated in ∼12\% of p35
  molecules. These are the first quantitative and site-specific measurements of
  phosphorylation of p35, demonstrating the usefulness of Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE}
  for analysis of phosphorylation states of in vivo proteins.%

  We provide a standard phosphate-affinity {SDS}-{PAGE} (Mn(2+)-Phos-tag
  {SDS}-{PAGE}) protocol, in which Phos-tag is used to analyze large
  phosphoproteins with molecular masses of more than 200 {kDa}. A previous
  protocol required a long electrophoresis time of 12 h for separation of
  phosphoisotypes of large proteins ( approximately 150 {kDa}). This protocol,
  which uses a 3\% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gel strengthened with 0.5\% (wt/vol)
  agarose, permits the separation of protein phosphoisotypes larger than 200
  {kDa} within 2 h. In subsequent immunoblotting, phosphoisotypes of
  high-molecular-mass proteins, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (289

  protein 1 (213 {kDa}), can be clearly detected as up-shifted migration bands
  on the improved Mn(2+)-Phos-tag {SDS}-{PAGE} gel. The procedure from the

  Deciphering transcription factor networks from microarray data remains
  difficult. This study presents a simple method to infer the regulation of
  transcription factors from microarray data based on well-characterized target
  genes. We generated a catalog containing transcription factors associated
  with 2720 target genes and 6401 experimentally validated regulations. When it
  was available, a distinction between transcriptional activation and
  inhibition was included for each regulation. Next, we built a tool
  (www.tfacts.org) that compares submitted gene lists with target genes in the
  catalog to detect regulated transcription factors. {TFactS} was validated
  with published lists of regulated genes in various models and compared to
  tools based on in silico promoter analysis. We next analyzed the {NCI}60
  cancer microarray data set and showed the regulation of {SOX}10, {MITF} and
  {JUN} in melanomas. We then performed microarray experiments comparing gene
  expression response of human fibroblasts stimulated by different growth
  factors. {TFactS} predicted the specific activation of Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription factors by {PDGF}-{BB}, which was confirmed
  experimentally. Our results show that the expression levels of transcription
  factor target genes constitute a robust signature for transcription factor
  regulation, and can be efficiently used for microarray data mining.%

  The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
  familywise error rate ({FWER}). This approach, though, has faults, and we
  point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance
  testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of
  falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is
  equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller
  otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery
  rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain
  in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control
  the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation
  study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new
  procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with
  examples.%

  Recent studies on the in vivo roles of the sterol regulatory element binding
  protein ({SREBP}) family indicate that {SREBP}-2 is more specific to
  cholesterogenic gene expression whereas {SREBP}-1 targets lipogenic genes. To
  define the molecular mechanism involved in this differential regulation,
  luciferase-reporter gene assays were performed in {HepG}2 cells to compare
  the transactivities of nuclear {SREBP}-1a, -1c, and -2 on a battery of
  {SREBP}-target promoters containing sterol regulatory element ({SRE}),
  {SRE}-like, or E-box sequences. The results show first that cholesterogenic
  genes containing classic {SREs} in their promoters are strongly and
  efficiently activated by both {SREBP}-1a and {SREBP}-2, but not by
  {SREBP}-1c. Second, an E-box containing reporter gene is much less
  efficiently activated by {SREBP}-1a and -1c, and {SREBP}-2 was inactive in
  spite of its ability to bind to the E-box. Third, promoters of lipogenic
  enzymes containing variations of {SRE} ({SRE}-like sequences) are strongly
  activated by {SREBP}-1a, and only modestly and equally by both {SREBP}-1c and
  -2. Finally, substitution of the unique tyrosine residue within the basic
  helix-loop-helix ({bHLH}) portion of nuclear {SREBPs} with arginine, the
  conserved residue found in all other {bHLH} proteins, abolishes the
  transactivity of all {SREBPs} for {SRE}, and conversely results in markedly
  increased activity of {SREBP}-1 but not activity of {SREBP}-2 for E-boxes.
  These data demonstrate the different specificity and affinity of nuclear
  {SREBP}-1 and -2 for different target {DNAs}, explaining a part of the
  mechanism behind the differential in vivo regulation of cholesterogenic and
  lipogenic enzymes by {SREBP}-1 and -2, respectively.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 ({SREBP}-1), a member of the
  basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper ({bHLH}-{ZIP}) family of transcription
  factors, is synthesized as a 125 kd precursor that is attached to the nuclear
  envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. In sterol-depleted cells, the
  membrane-bound precursor is cleaved to generate a soluble {NH}2-terminal
  fragment (apparent molecular mass, 68 kd) that translocates to the nucleus.
  This fragment, which includes the {bHLH}-{ZIP} domain, activates
  transcription of the genes for the {LDL} receptor and {HMG} {CoA} synthase.
  Sterols inhibit the cleavage of {SREBP}-1, and the 68 kd nuclear form is
  rapidly catabolized, thereby reducing transcription. {ALLN}, an inhibitor of
  neutral cysteine proteases, blocks the breakdown of the 68 kd form and
  superinduces sterol-regulated genes. Sterol-regulated proteolysis of a
  membrane-bound transcription factor provides a novel mechanism by which
  transcription can be regulated by membrane lipids.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The ability to design and engineer organisms demands the ability to predict
  kinetic responses of novel regulatory networks built from well-characterized
  biological components. Surprisingly, few validated kinetic models of complex
  regulatory networks have been derived by combining models of the network
  components. A major bottleneck in producing such models is the difficulty of
  measuring in vivo rate constants for components of complex networks. We
  demonstrate that a simple, genetic approach to measuring rate constants in
  vivo produces an accurate kinetic model of the complex network that
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae employs to regulate the expression of genes encoding
  glucose transporters. The model predicts a transient pulse of transcription
  of {HXT}4 (but not {HXT}2 or {HXT}3) in response to addition of a small
  amount of glucose to cells, an outcome we observed experimentally. Our model
  also provides a mechanistic explanation for this result: {HXT}2–4 are
  governed by a type 2, incoherent feed forward regulatory loop involving the
  Rgt1 and Mig2 transcriptional repressors. The efficiency with which Rgt1 and
  Mig2 repress expression of each {HXT} gene determines which of them have a
  pulse of transcription in response to glucose. Finally, the model correctly
  predicts how lesions in the feed forward loop change the kinetics of
  induction of {HXT}4 expression.%

  Many sensory systems, such as vision and hearing, show a response that is
  proportional to the fold-change in the stimulus relative to the background, a
  feature related to Weber’s law. Recent experiments suggest such a
  fold-change detection feature in signaling systems in cells: a response that
  depends on the fold-change in the input signal, and not on its absolute level
  (Cohen-Saidon et al., in press; Goentoro and Kirschner, submitted; both in
  this volume). It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of
  gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here we
  demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one
  of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent
  feedforward loop (I1-{FFL}), in which an activator regulates both a gene and
  a repressor of the gene.The fold-change detection feature of the I1-{FFL}
  applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and
  duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters.%

  Summary Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become an epidemic, and virtually no
  physician is without patients who have the disease. Whereas insulin
  insensitivity is an early phenomenon partly related to obesity, pancreas
  β-cell function declines gradually over time already before the onset of
  clinical hyperglycaemia. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including
  increased non-esterified fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and
  mitochondrial dysfunction for insulin resistance, and glucotoxicity,
  lipotoxicity, and amyloid formation for β-cell dysfunction. Moreover, the
  disease has a strong genetic component, but only a handful of genes have been
  identified so far: genes for calpain 10, potassium inward-rectifier 6·2,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, insulin receptor substrate-1,
  and others. Management includes not only diet and exercise, but also
  combinations of anti-hyperglycaemic drug treatment with lipid-lowering,
  antihypertensive, and anti platelet therapy.%

  The burden of obesity has increased globally over the last few decades and
  its association with insulin resistance and related cardio-metabolic problems
  have adversely affected our ability to reduce population morbidity and
  mortality. Traditionally, adipose tissue in the visceral fat depot has been
  considered a major culprit in the development of insulin resistance. However,
  there is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of subcutaneous
  truncal/abdominal adipose tissue in the development of insulin resistance.
  There are significant differences in the functional characteristics of
  subcutaneous abdominal/truncal vs. intraabdominal vs. gluteo-femoral fat
  depots. More recently, mounting evidence has been supporting the role of
  adipose tissue function in the development of metabolic complications
  independent of adipose tissue volume or distribution. Decreased capacity for
  adipocyte differentiation and angiogenesis along with adipocyte hypertrophy
  can trigger a vicious cycle of inflammation leading to subcutaneous adipose
  tissue dysfunction and ectopic fat deposition. Therapeutic lifestyle change
  continues to be the most important intervention in clinical practice to
  improve adipose tissue function and avoid development of insulin resistance
  and related cardio-metabolic complications.%

  Background Patients with diabetes already fulfill one diagnostic criterion
  for {MS} according to the existing classifications. Our aim was to identify
  one single clinical parameter, which could effectively predict the presence
  of {MS} in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods We studied all patients
  with type 2 diabetes who attended our Diabetes Outpatient Clinic during a
  three-month period. Waist circumference, blood pressure and serum lipids were
  measured. Establishment of {MS} diagnosis was based a) on National
  Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel {III} ({NCEP} {ATP}
  {III}) criteria and b) on International Diabetes Federation ({IDF}) criteria.
  Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis was applied in order to
  identify the clinical parameter with the highest predictive capability for
  {MS}. Among the 500 participating patients (231 males, 269 females), {MS} was
  diagnosed in 364 patients (72.8\%) according to the {NCEP} {ATP} {III}
  criteria and in 408 patients (81.6\%) according to the {IDF} criteria.
  Results For the {NCEP} {ATP} {III} classification, serum triglycerides (in
  the overall population), waist and {HDL} (in female population) demonstrated
  the highest predictive capability for {MS} ({AUCs}:0.786, 0.805 and 0.801,
  respectively). For the {IDF} classification, no single parameter reached an
  {AUC} {\textgreater} 0.800 in the overall population. In females, {HDL}
  displayed a satisfactory predictive capability for {MS} with an {AUC} which
  was significantly higher than the one in males (0.785 vs. 0.676,
  respectively, p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion Elevated serum triglycerides
  strongly indicate the presence of {MS} in patients with type 2 diabetes. In
  female patients with type 2 diabetes, central obesity was the second stronger
  predictor of {MS} besides hypertriglyceridemia.%

  In obese people, an increase of plasma leptin levels is well-known and is
  seen as a consequence of the increased body fat mass. Moreover, a
  relationship between fasting concentrations of leptin and insulin has been
  described. Hyperinsulinemia is considered to be indicative of insulin
  resistance. We aimed at elucidating the interrelations between leptin,
  insulin and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. Under metabolic
  ward conditions, we investigated 21 moderately overweight men with type 2
  diabetes. The patients had a mean age of 49.1 years, a mean body mass index
  ({BMI}) of 26.8 kg/m(2), and a mean diabetes duration of 82.5 months. All
  patients were treated with diet alone. We measured fasting leptin and insulin
  levels, body composition by determination of total body water, and insulin
  resistance by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. At univariate
  analysis, fasting leptin level significantly and positively correlated with
  {BMI} (r=0.49, p=0.02) and with fasting insulin (r=0.69, p=0.001), while it
  negatively correlated with the glucose disposal rate (r=-0.62, p=0.002).
  Furthermore, leptin was inversely correlated with {HDL}-cholesterol (r=-0.45,
  p=0.04). When excluding the influence of body fat mass or of {BMI} in partial
  correlation analysis, the correlations between leptin and insulin or insulin
  sensitivity remained significant. The relationship between insulin resistance
  (as measured directly in the clamp experiments) and leptin concentrations was
  also shown by subdividing the diabetic patients according to tertiles of
  insulin sensitivity. The highest fasting leptin levels were observed in those
  patients with the most expressed insulin resistance. Our data point to a
  functional relationship between insulin resistance and leptin concentrations
  in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic men, independently of body composition.
  This relationship is believed to be mediated by insulin.%

  Inflammatory mechanisms play a key role in the pathogenesis of type 1
  diabetes. Individuals who progress to type 2 diabetes display features of
  low-grade inflammation years in advance of disease onset. This low-grade
  inflammation has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenetic processes
  causing type 2 diabetes. Mediators of inflammation such as tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha, interleukin ({IL})-1beta, the {IL}-6 family of cytokines,
  {IL}-18, and certain chemokines have been proposed to be involved in the
  events causing both forms of diabetes. {IL}-6 has in addition to its
  immunoregulatory actions been proposed to affect glucose homeostasis and
  metabolism directly and indirectly by action on skeletal muscle cells,
  adipocytes, hepatocytes, pancreatic beta-cells, and neuroendocrine cells.
  Here we argue that {IL}-6 action-in part regulated by variance in the {IL}-6
  and {IL}-6alpha receptor genes-contributes to, but is probably neither
  necessary nor sufficient for, the development of both type 1 and type 2
  diabetes. Thus, the two types of diabetes are also in this respect less apart
  than apparent. However, the mechanisms are not clear, and we therefore
  propose future directions for studies in this field.%

  {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) is a crucial cellular energy sensor.
  Once activated by falling energy status, it promotes {ATP} production by
  increasing the activity or expression of proteins involved in catabolism
  while conserving {ATP} by switching off biosynthetic pathways. {AMPK} also
  regulates metabolic energy balance at the whole-body level. For example, it
  mediates the effects of agents acting on the hypothalamus that promote
  feeding and entrains circadian rhythms of metabolism and feeding behaviour.
  Finally, recent studies reveal that {AMPK} conserves {ATP} levels through the
  regulation of processes other than metabolism, such as the cell cycle and
  neuronal membrane excitability.%

  It has been known for many years that cellular metabolism within the solid
  tumour is markedly different from that of the corresponding normal tissue.
  The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ({HIF}1) has been
  implicated in regulating many of the genes that are responsible for the
  metabolic difference. However, it remains unclear how this 'aerobic
  glycolysis', originally described by Otto Warburg, offers tumour cells a
  growth advantage. As discussed in this Perspective, new data suggests that
  this metabolic switch may provide a benefit to the tumour not by increasing
  glycolysis but by decreasing mitochondrial activity.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Glucose and other carbohydrates are transported into cells using members of a
  family of integral membrane glucose transporter ({GLUT}) molecules. To date
  14 members of this family, also called the solute carrier 2A proteins have
  been identified which are divided on the basis of transport characteristics
  and sequence similarities into several families (Classes 1 to 3). The
  expression of these different receptor subtypes varies between different
  species, tissues and cellular subtypes and each has differential
  sensitivities to stimuli such as insulin. The liver is a contributor to
  metabolic carbohydrate homeostasis and is a major site for synthesis, storage
  and redistribution of carbohydrates. Situations in which the balance of
  glucose homeostasis is upset such as diabetes or the metabolic syndrome can
  lead metabolic disturbances that drive chronic organ damage and failure,
  confirming the importance of understanding the molecular regulation of
  hepatic glucose homeostasis. There is a considerable literature describing
  the expression and function of receptors that regulate glucose uptake and
  release by hepatocytes, the most import cells in glucose regulation and
  glycogen storage. However there is less appreciation of the roles of {GLUTs}
  expressed by non parenchymal cell types within the liver, all of which
  require carbohydrate to function. A better understanding of the detailed
  cellular distribution of {GLUTs} in human liver tissue may shed light on
  mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. This review summarises the
  available literature on hepatocellular expression of {GLUTs} in health and
  disease and highlights areas where further investigation is required.%

  {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) is a major therapeutic target for the
  treatment of diabetes. We investigated the effect of a short-term
  overexpression of {AMPK} specifically in the liver by adenovirus-mediated
  transfer of a gene encoding a constitutively active form of {AMPKα}2
  ({AMPKα}2-{CA}). Hepatic {AMPKα}2-{CA} expression significantly decreased
  blood glucose levels and gluconeogenic gene expression. Hepatic expression of
  {AMPKα}2-{CA} in streptozotocin-induced and ob/ob diabetic mice abolished
  hyperglycemia and decreased gluconeogenic gene expression. In normal mouse
  liver, {AMPKα}2-{CA} considerably decreased the refeeding-induced
  transcriptional activation of genes encoding proteins involved in glycolysis
  and lipogenesis and their upstream regulators, {SREBP}-1 (sterol regulatory
  element–binding protein-1) and {ChREBP} (carbohydrate response
  element–binding protein). This resulted in decreases in hepatic glycogen
  synthesis and circulating lipid levels. Surprisingly, despite the inhibition
  of hepatic lipogenesis, expression of {AMPKα}2-{CA} led to fatty liver due
  to the accumulation of lipids released from adipose tissue. The relative
  scarcity of glucose due to {AMPKα}2-{CA} expression led to an increase in
  hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone bodies production as an alternative
  source of energy for peripheral tissues. Thus, short-term {AMPK} activation
  in the liver reduces blood glucose levels and results in a switch from
  glucose to fatty acid utilization to supply energy needs.%

  The {AMP}-activated kinase ({AMPK}) is a serine threonine kinase that
  functions as a fuel sensor to regulate energy balance at both cellular and
  whole-body levels. Here we studied how hepatic {AMPKα}2 isoform affects
  hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake in vivo. We
  generated mice deleted for the {AMPKα}2 gene specifically in the liver
  (liverα2KO). Liverα2KO mice were glucose intolerant and hyperglycemic in
  the fasted state. Hyperglycemia was associated with a 50\% higher endogenous
  glucose production than in controls as assessed in vivo. We then investigated
  whether this increased glucose production was sensitive to insulin. Insulin,
  when infused at a rate inducing physiological hyperinsulinemia, totally
  inhibited endogenous glucose production in liverα2KO mice, showing that they
  had normal insulin sensitivity. This was confirmed in vivo by normal
  insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and transcriptional regulation of the
  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6 phosphatase, and pyruvate kinase
  in liver during the fasted/fed transition. Leptin and adiponectin regulate
  hepatic glucose production, so we then infused these adipokines into
  liverα2KO mice. Neither of these adipokines regulated hepatic glucose
  production in mice lacking hepatic {AMPKα}2, whereas both did so in control
  mice. In conclusion, we show that the hepatic {AMPKα}2 isoform is essential
  for suppressing hepatic glucose production and maintaining fasting blood
  glucose levels in the physiological range. We also demonstrate that
  regulation of hepatic glucose production by leptin and adiponectin, but not
  insulin, requires hepatic {AMPKα}2 activity.%

  Summary Thioredoxin-interacting protein ({TXNIP}) is an α-arrestin family
  protein that is induced in response to glucose elevation. It has been shown
  to provide a negative feedback loop to regulate glucose uptake into cells,
  though the biochemical mechanism of action has been obscure. Here, we report
  that {TXNIP} suppresses glucose uptake directly, by binding to the glucose
  transporter {GLUT}1 and inducing {GLUT}1 internalization through
  clathrin-coated pits, as well as indirectly, by reducing the level of {GLUT}1
  messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}). In addition, we show that energy stress results in
  the phosphorylation of {TXNIP} by {AMP}-dependent protein kinase ({AMPK}),
  leading to its rapid degradation. This suppression of {TXNIP} results in an
  acute increase in {GLUT}1 function and an increase in {GLUT}1 {mRNA} (hence
  the total protein levels) for long-term adaptation. The glucose influx
  through {GLUT}1 restores {ATP}-to-{ADP} ratios in the short run and
  ultimately induces {TXNIP} protein production to suppress glucose uptake once
  energy homeostasis is reestablished.%

  The fatty acid synthase ({FAS}) gene is significantly up-regulated in various
  types of cancers, and blocking the {FAS} expression results in apoptosis of
  tumor cells. Therefore, {FAS} is considered to be an attractive target for
  anticancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanism by which the {FAS} gene
  is up-regulated in tumor cells is poorly understood. We found that {FAS} was
  significantly up-regulated by hypoxia, which was also accompanied by reactive
  oxygen species ({ROS}) generation in human breast cancer cell lines. The
  {FAS} expression was also activated by H(2)O(2), whereas N-acetyl-L-cystein,
  a {ROS} inhibitor, suppressed the expression. We also found that the hypoxia
  significantly up-regulated sterol regulatory-element binding protein
  ({SREBP})-1, the major transcriptional regulator of the {FAS} gene, via
  phosphorylation of Akt followed by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1
  ({HIF}1). Moreover, our results of reporter assay and chromatin
  immunoprecipitation analysis indicate that {SREBP}-1 strongly bound to the
  {SREBP} binding site/E-box sequence on the {FAS} promoter under hypoxia. In
  our xenograft mouse model, {FAS} was strongly expressed in the hypoxic
  regions of the tumor. In addition, our results of immunohistochemical
  analysis for human breast tumor specimens indicate that the expressions of
  both {FAS} and {SREBP}-1 were colocalized with hypoxic regions in the tumors.
  Furthermore, we found that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to
  cyclophosphamide was partially blocked by a combination of {FAS} inhibitor
  and cyclophosphamide. Taken together, our results indicate that {FAS} gene is
  up-regulated by hypoxia via activation of the Akt and {HIF}1 followed by the
  induction of the {SREBP}-1 gene, and that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is
  partly due to the up-regulation of {FAS}.%

  The role of skeletal muscle in nonshivering thermogenesis ({NST}) is not well
  understood. Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator
  of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-{ATPase} (Serca) pump, is necessary
  for muscle-based thermogenesis. When challenged to acute cold (4 °C),
  Sln−/− mice were not able to maintain their core body temperature (37
  °C) and developed hypothermia. Surgical ablation of brown adipose tissue and
  functional knockdown of Ucp1 allowed us to highlight the role of muscle in
  {NST}. Overexpression of Sln in the Sln-null background fully restored
  muscle-based thermogenesis, suggesting that Sln is the basis for
  Serca-mediated heat production. We show that ryanodine receptor 1
  (Ryr1)-mediated Ca2+ leak is an important mechanism for Serca-activated heat
  generation. Here we present data to suggest that Sln can continue to interact
  with Serca in the presence of Ca2+, which can promote uncoupling of the Serca
  pump and cause futile cycling. We further show that loss of Sln predisposes
  mice to diet-induced obesity, which suggests that Sln-mediated {NST} is
  recruited during metabolic overload. These data collectively suggest that
  {SLN} is an important mediator of muscle thermogenesis and whole-body energy
  metabolism.%

  Systematic interrogation of gene function requires the ability to perturb

  structure-guided engineering of a {CRISPR}-Cas9 complex to mediate efficient
  transcriptional activation at endogenous genomic loci. We used these
  engineered Cas9 activation complexes to investigate single-guide {RNA}
  ({sgRNA}) targeting rules for effective transcriptional activation, to
  demonstrate multiplexed activation of ten genes simultaneously, and to
  upregulate long intergenic non-coding {RNA} ({lincRNA}) transcripts. We also
  synthesized a library consisting of 70,290 guides targeting all human
  {RefSeq} coding isoforms to screen for genes that, upon activation, confer
  resistance to a {BRAF} inhibitor. The top hits included genes previously
  shown to be able to confer resistance, and novel candidates were validated
  using individual {sgRNA} and complementary {DNA} overexpression. A gene
  signature based on the top screening hits correlated with a gene expression
  signature of {BRAF} inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived
  samples. These results collectively demonstrate the potential of Cas9-based
  activators as a powerful genetic perturbation technology.%

  Targeted gene regulation on a genome-wide scale is a powerful strategy for
  interrogating, perturbing, and engineering cellular systems. Here, we develop
  a method for controlling gene expression based on Cas9, an {RNA}-guided {DNA}
  endonuclease from a type {II} {CRISPR} system. We show that a catalytically
  dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide {RNA},
  generates a {DNA} recognition complex that can specifically interfere with
  transcriptional elongation, {RNA} polymerase binding, or transcription factor
  binding. This system, which we call {CRISPR} interference ({CRISPRi}), can
  efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no
  detectable off-target effects. {CRISPRi} can be used to repress multiple
  target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show
  evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian
  cells. This {RNA}-guided {DNA} recognition platform provides a simple
  approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale.%

  {IN} {BRIEF} Considering there are potentially seven points within a 24-hour
  glucose profile (pre-meals, post-meals, and at bedtime), the question of
  which of these values to target is important to both patients and busy
  practitioners. Appropriate targeting of plasma glucose may lead to less
  expense and less unnecessary testing for patients and may help patients and
  practitioners achieve glucose goals more expeditiously. This article suggests
  that targeting fasting plasma glucose is more beneficial when hemoglobin A1c
  (A1C) results are very high, whereas targeting postprandial glucose is more
  effective when A1C results are lower.%

  To investigate the effect of postprandial plasma glucose ({PG})
  concentrations on {HbA}1c levels in type 2 diabetic patients, we evaluated
  the relationship between {HbA}1c levels and postprandial {PG} concentrations
  after a meal tolerance test in 35 type 2 diabetic patients who had fasting
  {PG} concentrations persistently \&lt;7.8 mmol/l and stable {HbA}1c levels.
  Two-hour postprandial {PG} concentrations were found to be more strongly
  correlated (r=0.51) with {HbA}1c levels than 1-h postprandial {PG} (r=0.35)
  and fasting {PG} (r=0.46) concentrations. Patients whose {HbA}1c levels were
  high ({HbA}1c≥7\%) had significantly higher 2-h postprandial {PG}
  concentrations and areas under the glucose curve than those whose {HbA}1c
  levels were lower (8.12±1.10 ({SD}) vs 6.70±2.22 mmol l−1, P=0.004 and
  17.43±1.92 vs 15.58±3.26 mmol h−1 l−1, P=0.02, respectively). Although
  fasting {PG} concentrations of patients with higher {HbA}1c levels were
  slightly higher, they did not differ significantly from those with lower
  {HbA}1c levels (6.21±0.89 vs 5.73±0.68 mmol l−1). Age, duration of
  diabetes, body mass index, serum C-peptide, both fasting and postprandial,
  did not differ between these two groups. This study suggests that
  postprandial hyperglycemia, particularly 2-h postprandial {PG}
  concentrations, is associated with high {HbA}1c levels in type 2 diabetic
  patients whose fasting {PG} levels were within normal or near-normal levels.%

  {RNA} interference ({RNAi})-based therapeutics have the potential to treat

  Dynamic {PolyConjugate} ({DPC}) for the targeted delivery of {siRNAs} to
  hepatocytes. Here, we first show in proof-of-concept studies that simple
  coinjection of a hepatocyte-targeted, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated
  melittin-like peptide ({NAG}-{MLP}) with a liver-tropic
  cholesterol-conjugated {siRNA} (chol-{siRNA}) targeting coagulation factor
  {VII} (F7) results in efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates
  without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines. Using
  transient and transgenic mouse models of {HBV} infection, we show that a
  single coinjection of {NAG}-{MLP} with potent chol-{siRNAs} targeting
  conserved {HBV} sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral {RNA},
  proteins, and viral {DNA} with long duration of effect. These results suggest
  that coinjection of {NAG}-{MLP} and chol-{siHBVs} holds great promise as a
  new therapeutic for patients chronically infected with {HBV}.%

  In this study, we developed anionic polymer-coated liposome/{siRNA} complexes
  (lipoplexes) with chondroitin sulfate C ({CS}), poly-l-glutamic acid ({PGA})
  and poly-aspartic acid ({PAA}) for {siRNA} delivery by intravenous injection,
  and evaluated the biodistribution and gene silencing effect in mice. The
  sizes of {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes were about 200 nm and
  their ζ-potentials were negative. {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes
  did not induce agglutination after mixing with erythrocytes. In terms of
  biodistribution, {siRNAs} after intravenous administration of cationic
  lipoplexes were largely observed in the lungs, but those of {CS}-, {PGA}- and
  {PAA}-coated lipoplexes were in both the liver and the kidneys, indicating
  that {siRNA} might be partially released from the anionic polymer-coated
  lipoplexes in the blood circulation and accumulate in the kidney, although
  the lipoplexes can prevent the agglutination with blood components. To
  increase the association between {siRNA} and cationic liposome, we used
  cholesterol-modified {siRNA} ({siRNA}-Chol) for preparation of the
  lipoplexes. When {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes of {siRNA}-Chol
  were injected into mice, {siRNA}-Chol was mainly observed in the liver, not
  in the kidneys. In terms of the suppression of gene expression in vivo,
  apolipoprotein B ({ApoB}) {mRNA} in the liver was significantly reduced
  48 h after single intravenous injection of {PGA}-coated lipoplex of {ApoB}
  {siRNA}-Chol (2.5 mg {siRNA}/kg), but not cationic, {CS}- and
  {PAA}-coated lipoplexes. In terms of toxicity after intravenous injection,
  {CS}-, {PGA}- and {PAA}-coated lipoplexes did not increase {GOT} and {GPT}
  concentrations in blood. From these findings, {PGA} coatings for cationic
  lipoplex of {siRNA}-Chol might produce a systemic vector of {siRNA} to the
  liver.%

  Complex cellular networks regulate regeneration, detoxification and
  differentiation of hepatocytes. By combining experimental data with
  mathematical modelling, systems biology holds great promises to elucidate the
  key regulatory mechanisms involved and predict targets for efficient
  intervention. For the generation of high-quality quantitative data suitable
  for mathematical modelling a standardised in vitro system is essential.
  Therefore the authors developed standard operating procedures for the
  preparation and cultivation of primary mouse hepatocytes. To reliably monitor
  the dynamic induction of signalling pathways, the authors established
  starvation conditions and evaluated the extent of starvation-associated
  stress by quantifying several metabolic functions of cultured primary
  hepatocytes, namely activities of glutathione-S-transferase, glutamine
  synthetase, {CYP}3A as well as secretion of lactate and urea into the culture
  medium. Establishment of constant metabolic activities after an initial
  decrease compared with freshly isolated hepatocytes showed that the cultured
  hepatocytes achieve a new equilibrium state that was not affected by our
  starving conditions. To verify the highly reproducible dynamic activation of
  signalling pathways in the in vitro system, the authors examined the
  {JAK}-{STAT}, {SMAD}, {PI}3 kinase, {MAP} kinase, {NF}-{kappaB} and
  Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways. For the induction of gp130, {JAK}1 and
  {STAT}3 phosphorylation {IL}6 was used, whereas {TGFbeta} was applied to
  activate the phosphorylation of {SMAD}1, {SMAD}2 and {SMAD}3. Both Akt/{PKB}
  and {ERK}1/2 phosphorylation were stimulated by the addition of hepatocyte
  growth factor. The time-dependent induction of a pool of signalling competent
  beta-catenin was monitored in response to the inhibition of {GSK}3beta. To
  analyse whether phosphorylation is actually leading to transcriptional
  responses, luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by multiple copies of
  {TGFbeta}-responsive motives were applied, demonstrating a dose-dependent
  increase in luciferase activity. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis by the
  {TNF}-like cytokine Fas ligand was studied in the in vitro system. Thus, the
  mouse hepatocyte in vitro system provides an important basis for the
  generation of high-quality quantitative data under standardised cell culture
  conditions that is essential to elucidate critical hepatocellular functions
  by the systems biology approach.%

  Tissues from rhesus monkeys were screened by {PCR} for the presence of
  sequences homologous to known adeno-associated virus ({AAV}) serotypes 1–6.
  {DNA} spanning entire rep-cap {ORFs} from two novel {AAVs}, called {AAV}7 and
  {AAV}8, were isolated. Sequence comparisons among these and previously
  described {AAVs} revealed the greatest divergence in capsid proteins. {AAV}7
  and {AAV}8 were not neutralized by heterologous antisera raised to the other
  serotypes. Neutralizing antibodies to {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were rare in human
  serum and, when present, were low in activity. Vectors formed with capsids
  from {AAV}7 and {AAV}8 were generated by using rep and inverted terminal
  repeats ({ITRs}) from {AAV}2 and were compared with similarly constructed
  vectors made from capsids of {AAV}1, {AAV}2, and {AAV}5. Murine models of
  skeletal muscle and liver-directed gene transfer were used to evaluate
  relative vector performance. {AAV}7 vectors demonstrated efficiencies of
  transgene expression in skeletal muscle equivalent to that observed with
  {AAV}1, the most efficient known serotype for this application. In liver,
  transgene expression was 10- to 100-fold higher with {AAV}8 than observed
  with other serotypes. This improved efficiency correlated with increased
  persistence of vector {DNA} and higher number of transduced hepatocytes. The
  efficiency of {AAV}8 vector for liver-directed gene transfer of factor {IX}
  was not impacted by preimmunization with the other {AAV} serotypes. Vectors
  based on these novel, nonhuman primate {AAVs} should be considered for human
  gene therapy because of low reactivity to antibodies directed to human {AAVs}
  and because gene transfer efficiency in muscle was similar to that obtained
  with the best known serotype, whereas, in liver, gene transfer was
  substantially higher than previously described.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A rapid method based on a defined methanol-chloroform-water mixture for the
  quantitative precipitation of soluble as well as hydrophobic proteins from
  dilute solutions (e.g., column chromatography effluents) has been developed.
  The effectiveness of this method is not affected by the presence of
  detergents, lipids, salt, buffers, and beta-mercaptoethanol.%
